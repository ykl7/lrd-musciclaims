(Bottom) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms, with staining of discrete cells but in differing numbers between worms from “low” (left) and “high” (right) cultures. Here, enrichment in eyespots is more evident in the low worm and enrichment in other neural structures (brain lobes) is more evident in the high worm (eyespots obscured). (B) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in brain lobes and eyespots. (Top [worm from low culture] and middle [worm from high culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (magenta) are visible in 20-μm Z-stacks of sectioned brain lobes (sections taken just posterior to the eyespots; brain lobes outlined with dotted lines), in some cases colocalizing in cells with the cholinergic neuron marker ChAT (green).

(C) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in stem cell-rich compartments in worm trunk regions. Staining for piwi-1 (magenta) identifies numerous stem cells in this field. Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1. The area surrounded by a dotted box is enlarged in the bottom row to show lack of colocalization between SmedTV and piwi-1, suggesting their respective presence in distinct cells.

SmedTV levels are higher in multiple, but not all, differentiated tissue types. Data in the lighter-shaded area are from Molinaro and Pearson (32) (head enriched), and data in the darker-shaded area are from Wurtzel et al. (31) (postpharyngeal). The generally higher levels of SmedTV seen in the Pearson lab data could be due to differences in tissue selectivity or culture conditions.

Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1.

HGSC cells harbor a high degree of GI that results in small nicks and breaks in the DNA over time. Sensor proteins such as γH2Ax are recruited to the site of damage to prevent DNA degradation and remain in check until a repair mechanism is triggered. The minimally functional HR machinery is activated and prompts the recruitment of the main downstream effector protein, RAD51, which by keeping those damaging signals at bay, allows cancer cells to survive, even if with relatively higher baseline levels of γH2Ax when compared with normal cells. For this reason, ovarian cancer cells are known to functionally tolerate and survive high baseline levels of DNA damage while avoiding apoptotic cues (left). When SMAP-061 is added to the cell, PP2A’s antitumor activity is functionally restored, and synthetic lethality is induced (right). RAD51 expression is inhibited by PP2A, preventing the HR output to be efficiently propagated. This results in the incapacity of the cells to repair their inherent DNA damage, thereby leading to the accumulation of γH2Ax signals in the nucleus, and ultimately, triggering apoptosis (schematic created with BioRender.com).",./data/PMC10157366/images/figure_7.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/88db/10157366/b961cc8a1949/599fig7.jpg,SUPPORT,"Our studies introduce a unique mechanism of synthetic lethality, through a small-molecule mediator of PP2A that potently reduces RAD51 expression, leading to concomitant apoptosis.",ALL_PANELS

In FBD, we defined the fossil age either using a minimum age (FBD tip date) or an age range (FBD age range). Each dating method was carried out with a smaller (s) or larger (l) fossil set (fossil number for each approach indicated in square brackets). Since node dating only uses the oldest fossil per node, this resulted in fewer fossils used in the small and the large fossil set in ND compared to FBD.

Scale bar indicates average number of substitutions per alignment position. (A) Deduced amino acid sequences of the translated ORF2 (RdRp) regions of each virus were aligned using MAFFT 7 (L-INS-i). The following were found to apply by ModelFinder: best-fit model according to BIC, LG+F+R5; model of rate heterogeneity, FreeRate with five categories; site proportion and rates, 0.0183 and 0.0138, 0.0662 and 0.1754, 0.2240 and 0.4485, 0.4203 and 0.9564, and 0.2712 and 1.7908, respectively. See Table S2 for summary of virus names, abbreviations, and RefSeq accession numbers. Three putative arthropod viruses branching nearest to the tricladiviruses are labeled in orange. The only formally assigned Totiviridae member with sufficient sequence similarity to appear in the tree, GLV, is labeled in cyan. Tentatively assigned totiviruses LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, identified as being related to the tricladiviruses in BLASTX searches as described in the text, are labeled in green. Viruses that have been previously shown to form isometric viral capsids are marked with hexagons. (B) Nucleotide sequences of 11 newly assembled SmedTV strain sequences were aligned using MAFFT 7 (L-INS-i). The following was found to apply by ModelFinder: best-fit model according to BIC, HKY+I.

Fig 1.",PMC8158921_figure_2,Fig 2. There is no “one size fits all” approach to design or implement productive lab meetings.,"Here are 2 different examples of how to envision lab meetings, the structures of goals, timelines, and collective or individual responsibilities. (A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session). The lab mission carries the most weight (heavier measurement), the group objectives carry less weight but are important, the roles and rules involve frequent, small, finely tuned changes to get to the end goal/s. The target (under the magnifying glass) can change through time indicating flexibility and adaptability.",./data/PMC8158921/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/72bb/8158921/9b0cc121c410/pcbi.1008953.g002.jpg,NEUTRAL,"The key to planning productive lab meetings boils down to discussing and determining as a team the answers to why, who, what, where, when, and how: Why are lab meetings important for the functioning of the lab?

The term ""case studies"" is used in a general sense to describe any study of reproducibility.5 A reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. A refactor involves refactoring existing code into frameworks and reproducible best practices while preserving the original data. A replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. A test of robustness applies various protocols, workflows, statistical models, or parameters to a given dataset to study their effect on results. A census is a high-level tabulation conducted by a third party. A survey is a questionnaire sent to practitioners. A case narrative is an in-depth first-person account.

There is no “one size fits all” approach to design or implement productive lab meetings.,"Here are 2 different examples of how to envision lab meetings, the structures of goals, timelines, and collective or individual responsibilities. (A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session). The lab mission carries the most weight (heavier measurement), the group objectives carry less weight but are important, the roles and rules involve frequent, small, finely tuned changes to get to the end goal/s. The target (under the magnifying glass) can change through time indicating flexibility and adaptability.",./data/PMC8158921/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/72bb/8158921/9b0cc121c410/pcbi.1008953.g002.jpg,NEUTRAL,"In this article we speak from our experience, as a lab group at the University of Massachusetts that meets regularly.",ALL_PANELS

There is no “one size fits all” approach to design or implement productive lab meetings.,"Here are 2 different examples of how to envision lab meetings, the structures of goals, timelines, and collective or individual responsibilities. (A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session). The lab mission carries the most weight (heavier measurement), the group objectives carry less weight but are important, the roles and rules involve frequent, small, finely tuned changes to get to the end goal/s.

The visualization follows the same convention as in Figs. 4 and 5. However, Hilton et al.’s (26) dataset contains languages that are not in our dataset. Therefore, slightly different color mapping was applied (compare fig. S16). Note that some large effect sizes (D > 3.5) in the pitch height of our original analysis (i.e., full, SA, 20 s) are not observed in the automated analysis (i.e., full, FA, full length). This is due to estimation errors in the automated analyses.
