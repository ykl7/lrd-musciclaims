HGSC cells harbor a high degree of GI that results in small nicks and breaks in the DNA over time. Sensor proteins such as γH2Ax are recruited to the site of damage to prevent DNA degradation and remain in check until a repair mechanism is triggered. The minimally functional HR machinery is activated and prompts the recruitment of the main downstream effector protein, RAD51, which by keeping those damaging signals at bay, allows cancer cells to survive, even if with relatively higher baseline levels of γH2Ax when compared with normal cells. For this reason, ovarian cancer cells are known to functionally tolerate and survive high baseline levels of DNA damage while avoiding apoptotic cues (left). When SMAP-061 is added to the cell, PP2A’s antitumor activity is functionally restored, and synthetic lethality is induced (right). RAD51 expression is inhibited by PP2A, preventing the HR output to be efficiently propagated. This results in the incapacity of the cells to repair their inherent DNA damage, thereby leading to the accumulation of γH2Ax signals in the nucleus, and ultimately, triggering apoptosis (schematic created with BioRender.com).",./data/PMC10157366/images/figure_7.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/88db/10157366/b961cc8a1949/599fig7.jpg,SUPPORT,"Our studies introduce a unique mechanism of synthetic lethality, through a small-molecule mediator of PP2A that potently reduces RAD51 expression, leading to concomitant apoptosis.",ALL_PANELS

(A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session). The lab mission carries the most weight (heavier measurement), the group objectives carry less weight but are important, the roles and rules involve frequent, small, finely tuned changes to get to the end goal/s.

Much of the contact between network members is very infrequent (see Fig. 1)


Relationships need to be enhanced but members do not want more frequent meetings
Communication can improve by incorporating discussion of young parents’ needs into existing meetings

The Pathways project is an opportunity for network members to identify the most effective intensity of collaboration needed



Which organizations are ‘key players’?
C

Fig 1.",PMC8158921_figure_2,Fig 2. There is no “one size fits all” approach to design or implement productive lab meetings.,"Here are 2 different examples of how to envision lab meetings, the structures of goals, timelines, and collective or individual responsibilities. (A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session). The lab mission carries the most weight (heavier measurement), the group objectives carry less weight but are important, the roles and rules involve frequent, small, finely tuned changes to get to the end goal/s. The target (under the magnifying glass) can change through time indicating flexibility and adaptability.",./data/PMC8158921/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/72bb/8158921/9b0cc121c410/pcbi.1008953.g002.jpg,NEUTRAL,"The key to planning productive lab meetings boils down to discussing and determining as a team the answers to why, who, what, where, when, and how: Why are lab meetings important for the functioning of the lab?

A refactor involves refactoring existing code into frameworks and reproducible best practices while preserving the original data. A replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. A test of robustness applies various protocols, workflows, statistical models, or parameters to a given dataset to study their effect on results.

Rerunning the analyses on four different samples using different fundamental frequency extraction methods.,"Three features could be directly compared between the different samples: pitch height (A), pitch stability (B), and timbral brightness (C). The following samples were compared: (i) Our full sample (matched song and speech recordings from our 75 coauthors); (ii) Hilton et al.’s (26) full sample (matched song and speech recordings from 209 individuals); (iii) a subsample of our 14 coauthors singing/speaking in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Kannada, and Polish; and (iv) a subsample of Hilton et al.’s (26) 122 participants also singing/speaking in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Kannada, and Polish). “SA” means that f0 values are extracted in a semiautomated manner (compare the “Pitch height” section in the Supplementary Materials), while “FA” means they were exactly in a fully automated manner (using the pYIN algorithm). The visualization follows the same convention as in Figs. 4 and 5. However, Hilton et al.’s (26) dataset contains languages that are not in our dataset. Therefore, slightly different color mapping was applied (compare fig. S16). Note that some large effect sizes (D > 3.5) in the pitch height of our original analysis (i.e., full, SA, 20 s) are not observed in the automated analysis (i.e., full, FA, full length).

HGSC cells harbor a high degree of GI that results in small nicks and breaks in the DNA over time. Sensor proteins such as γH2Ax are recruited to the site of damage to prevent DNA degradation and remain in check until a repair mechanism is triggered. The minimally functional HR machinery is activated and prompts the recruitment of the main downstream effector protein, RAD51, which by keeping those damaging signals at bay, allows cancer cells to survive, even if with relatively higher baseline levels of γH2Ax when compared with normal cells. For this reason, ovarian cancer cells are known to functionally tolerate and survive high baseline levels of DNA damage while avoiding apoptotic cues (left). When SMAP-061 is added to the cell, PP2A’s antitumor activity is functionally restored, and synthetic lethality is induced (right). RAD51 expression is inhibited by PP2A, preventing the HR output to be efficiently propagated. This results in the incapacity of the cells to repair their inherent DNA damage, thereby leading to the accumulation of γH2Ax signals in the nucleus, and ultimately, triggering apoptosis (schematic created with BioRender.com).",./data/PMC10157366/images/figure_7.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/88db/10157366/b961cc8a1949/599fig7.jpg,SUPPORT,"Thus, further studies are necessary to assess the mechanism by which PP2A and SMAP-061 regulate RAD51.",ALL_PANELS

Divergence times in Pinus

Our FBD analyses suggest a Pinus crown lineage divergence in the Early Cretaceous (node a in Fig. 2), irrespective of whether the large fossil set (FBDl: median: 125 Ma, 95% credible interval, CI: 144–106 Ma; Fig. 3) or the small fossil set (FBDs: median: 124 Ma, 95% CI: 145–105 Ma) was used.",PMC5381128_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"Flow chart illustrating the different dating methods applied. We used both the node dating (ND) and the fossilized birth-death (FBD) method. In ND, we defined the calibration densities on calibration nodes either with narrower (NDn) or broader (NDb) log normal priors on age. NDu is the analog of NDb with uniform priors. In FBD, we defined the fossil age either using a minimum age (FBD tip date) or an age range (FBD age range). Each dating method was carried out with a smaller (s) or larger (l) fossil set (fossil number for each approach indicated in square brackets). Since node dating only uses the oldest fossil per node, this resulted in fewer fossils used in the small and the large fossil set in ND compared to FBD.

In ND, we defined the calibration densities on calibration nodes either with narrower (NDn) or broader (NDb) log normal priors on age. NDu is the analog of NDb with uniform priors. In FBD, we defined the fossil age either using a minimum age (FBD tip date) or an age range (FBD age range). Each dating method was carried out with a smaller (s) or larger (l) fossil set (fossil number for each approach indicated in square brackets). Since node dating only uses the oldest fossil per node, this resulted in fewer fossils used in the small and the large fossil set in ND compared to FBD. A control run (FBDs/l_ctrl) was additionally executed for FBD in which exactly the same fossils as in NDs/l were used",./data/PMC5381128/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a903/5381128/ed78caed803d/12862_2017_941_Fig1_HTML.jpg,NEUTRAL,"Last, the FBDl analysis (21 fossils) provides significantly older estimates than does the FBDs analysis (14 fossils).",a
