ALL_PANELS,"Currently, the editorial board members of CiOS are from 13 different countries; there should be additional recruitment from more than 20 countries to promote submission of manuscripts from all over the world (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"A predominantly large number of articles (366 out of 392, 91.8%) were submitted only by authors from Korea, USA, Japan, and India, which can be overcome by recruiting new editorial board members from a variety of countries (Fig. 4)."

ALL_PANELS,"Given the abundance of non-perennial streams both within the U.S. (Figure 1) and globally [11], and the prospect of declining stream flows in the future [16,27,28], accurately characterizing streamflow permanence represents a major challenge to understanding water availability now and throughout the 21st century [24,25]."
ALL_PANELS,"Consequently, there have been several recent calls to fill this critical data gap [29–31], with van Meerveld et al. [31] aptly likening the lack of knowledge of non-perennial headwater streams to, “a puzzle with most pieces still under the carpet.”
Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"As of June 2020, the federal policy defining WOTUS (“Navigable Waters Protection Rule,” [9]) considers jurisdictional tributaries as those that are perennial or intermittent (Table 1) and contribute surface water flow to a traditional navigable water or territorial sea in a typical year (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The rule includes upstream perennial and intermittent streams that have connections to downstream WOTUS through ephemeral streams or breaks, but only if the connecting ephemeral stream carries flow in a typical year (Figure 2c), otherwise the upstream perennial and intermittent streams are excluded from WOTUS (Figure 2d, [8])."
"c, d","Here, we highlight that the particular details on surface flow timing and spatial configuration of flowing and nonflowing stream segments relative to each other (e.g., Figure 2c,d) further underscores the need for tools that include accurate mapping and modeling of surface flow presence/absence to implement policies and management decisions (e.g., jurisdictional determinations, water quality standards, riparian buffer rules) based on surface flow regime and network position."
ALL_PANELS,"Consequently, databases are often siloed within the host agency and can remain either unknown or not readily available for access outside the agency, even though they may be the only streamflow information for this part of the stream network (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,These efforts provide an opportunity for rapid data collection over potentially extensive geographic regions as a low-cost approach toward filling this data gap to characterize streamflow permanence (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Crowdsourcing can be an effective mechanism for rapidly generating sizable datasets on streamflow permanence that rival or exceed existing datasets derived from other agency surveys (Figure 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Note, only CrowdWater observations located in the United States and shown in Figure 3 are included here."
ALL_PANELS,"However, in many headwater locations, identifying the appropriate flowline or stream grid cell can be difficult, especially with an automated approach, if multiple potential stream features may be relatively close to the observation location (Figure 5)."

ALL_PANELS,"About ⅓ of these lakes (125,993) intersect with line features that represent the national stream network of the medium-resolution NHD (on-network lakes; e.g., Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The remaining 252,095 lakes are geographically isolated from NHD stream lines (off-network lakes; Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Red lakes (n = 252,095) are geographically isolated from stream lines and are designated as ‘off-network’ lakes within LakeCat.Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, lake 7 is directly and indirectly connected to lakes 1, 4, 5, and 6 and the aggregation of these catchments is its watershed.On-network lakes
Each on-network lake intersects with ≥1 NHDPlusV2 stream lines (blue lines in Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the red area in Fig. 2 is the aggregation of all upstream catchments of Marion Lake, Oregon."
ALL_PANELS,"On-network lakes can have several catchments that feed directly into a lake, such as Marion Lake in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, all catchments that overlap with Marion Lake in Fig. 2 are aggregated and reported as the local catchment for this lake (i.e., black stippled area).Off-network lakes
To maintain consistency with the terminology used in the NHDPlusV2 and StreamCat, we also called areas that were hydrologically connected to off-network lakes catchments (i.e., colored areas surrounding lakes 1–7 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"In Fig. 3, catchments 1, 4, 5, and 6 contribute flow directly and indirectly to lake-catchment 7, and the integration of these catchments represent its full watershed."
ALL_PANELS,"For off-network lakes, we delineated the local contributing areas for each, excluding nested contributions from upslope lakes (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"We hydrologically linked these catchments to produce watershed metrics for each off-network lake (see Linking off-network lake catchments below).Generating off-network lake catchments
To delineate catchments of off-network lakes, we first converted lake polygons to GIS rasters, where the values of lake pixels were their numerical identifiers (unique identifiers [IDs] called COMIDs) in the NHDPlusV2 (numbered polygons in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"For lakes with no additional upslope lakes (i.e., a headwater lake), a catchment and watershed are the same geographic unit (e.g., lakes 1–4 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"For a series of hydrologically connected lakes, this delineation process results in a series of nested catchments, where the border of the downslope lake’s catchment ends at the initiation of the next upslope lake’s catchment, usually at the edge of the upslope lake itself (e.g., lakes 1, 4–7 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, catchments 1 to 4 in Fig. 3 are headwater catchments and are listed in rows of the TO column and have FROM-column values of 0, i.e., 0 in the FROM column denotes headwater catchments."
ALL_PANELS,"Catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 3 do not connect hydrologically to any downslope lakes and eventually flow to the nearby stream segment (arrows indicate hydrologic connections in Fig. 3), Thus, catchments 2 and 3 are listed in the TO column but are absent from the FROM column."
ALL_PANELS,"To illustrate our approach, we provide the steps used to determine that catchments 6 and 7 in Fig. 3 have a south-to-north flow connection in Fig. 4."
ALL_PANELS,"The process to connect these catchments was as follows:


Shift the catchment raster (Cat) southward by 1 pixel (shifted raster = Catʹ in Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Note that the entire raster Cat is shifted southward to produce Catʹ, but only the area under the fixed 3 × 3 window is depicted in Fig. 4."
ALL_PANELS,Apply a logical query to identify where Cat ≠ Catʹ and set the output raster (Query1) equal to 1 where true (Fig. 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Apply a 2nd logical query to identify values in the flow direction raster that indicate northward flow (ESRI flow-direction rasters use value = 64 to represent northward flow), and set output raster (Query2) equal to 1 where true (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead, shifting and subsequent queries and mathematical operations are conducted on the entire raster data set at once to improve efficiency and to make implementation easier with existing geographic information system tools.The result of step 4 is a raster (ToCat1) (Fig. 4) with pixels at the northern edge of the south-to-north border that meet the criteria of steps 2 and 3, but now have values of Catʹ rather than Cat."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, a regression of the % of the watershed composed of cropland from each data set had an r2 = 0.91 and a slope = 0.96 (Fig. 5)."

3a,The results demonstrated that the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in DM mice and decreased after bezafibrate treatment (Fig. 3A).
3b,Testicular caspase 3 activity was also measured and the results revealed that bezafibrate suppressed the elevated caspase 3 activity in DM mice (Fig. 3B).
3d,"The inhibitory effects of bezafibrate on cell apoptosis were further confirmed by Western blot results showing that bezafibrate decreased the protein expression of Bax, but increased the protein expression of Bcl-2 in DM mice (Fig. 3D)."
"a, b, c, d, e","The results demonstrated that after PPARα deletion, the protective effects of bezafibrate on spermatogenesis function were ablated, as manifested by the alterations in testis weight, histological morphology, sperm viability and sperm motility as well as serum testosterone level were not changed by bezafibrate after PPARα deletion (Fig. 8A–E)."
"f, g",TUNEL staining and caspase 3 activity detection also revealed that the anti-apoptotic effects of bezafibrate in testis were abolished by PPARα deletion (Fig. 8F and G).

ALL_PANELS,"Using PPARα knockout mice or the specific inhibitors, we indicated that the protective effects of bezafibrate against DM-induced male subfertility were dependent on PPARα (Fig. 7, Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"The protection of bezafibrate on spermatogenesis dysfunction was abrogated after PPARα deletion or inhibition (Fig. 7, Fig. 8), further confirming the critical role of PPARα in the protective effects provided by bezafibrate against diabetes-related spermatogenesis dysfunction."

ALL_PANELS,"Because we aimed to differentiate theoretically meaningful profiles from undifferentiated profiles, we selected the 3-profile over the 2-profile solution at each age, after Wald Z-tests confirmed all profiles were significantly different in key indicator means (see Figure 1), because the former was supported by better class separation, adequate percent membership in each profile, and theoretically-meaningful structure."

ALL_PANELS,"From a mechanistic standpoint, genomic alterations associated with resistance may be divided into two categories: resistance through the disruption of the cell cycle machinery (including alterations in RB1, CCNE1, CDK6, CDK4, p16, CDK2, CDK7, CCND1 or INK) and resistance through compensatory upstream signalling (alterations in PI3K, PTEN, FGFR1/2, FAT1/HIPPO, ERBB2 or RAS signalling) (Figure 1)."

Open in a new tabIn this paper, we describe the IRBAS database, including how users can contribute to it and access data."
ALL_PANELS,"Together with general metadata (e.g., data contributor and associated publication information; Table 1), these types of data are each uniquely identified and linked to an individual and uniquely identified dataset, which is entered into the database by a contributor through the use of template files (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"These pages explain how to:


1Step 1. contribute data

get started as a registered user
fill in data entry templates
save the completed templates




2Step 2. insert completed templates into the database


3Step 3. explore the database and request data

via a map interface (identifying locations of samples and extracting metadata)
via queries (performing more detailed data requests and extraction) (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Steps 1 and 2 result in the contribution of a dataset to the IRBAS database (see Figure 1), which requires users to register, fill in templates with data (solid arrows indicate mandatory templates and broken arrows optional templates), save these as.csv files, and then insert them into the IRBAS database via the IRBAS interface."
ALL_PANELS,"Step 2 involves a quality control and assurance parsing process to ensure data are inserted correctly, completely, and in accordance with the standardization requirements of the database, and the checking of taxonomic nomenclature in the Biota file against the IRBAS taxonomic library (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Step 1: Contributing data
Contributing data first requires setting up a username and password to become a registered user of the IRBAS database (Step 1a; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Registered users wishing to contribute data can download empty template spreadsheets (in the form of tab‐delimited .txt files) that are used to standardize the format, units, and terminology of datasets, samples, and measures (Step 1b; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"For each dataset submitted, a completed Site and Biota template must be provided (i.e., completion of these two templates is mandatory); completion of the Environment template is optional (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The general metadata must be uniform across each Site, Biota, and Environment templates that encapsulate a unique dataset (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,Contributors must save their completed templates (Step 1c; Figure 2) before insertion into the database.3.2.
ALL_PANELS,"Step 2: Inserting data
Saved, completed templates are inserted into the database via the interface's file‐selection dialog box (Step 2; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"All names of taxa supplied by contributors are parsed via a list of names stored on the database (the IRBAS taxonomic library), recognized by EOL, before datasets are inserted (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"These data were collected from intermittent rivers (and in some cases also from nearby perennial rivers) in North America (USA, 3 datasets), Europe (France, Spain, and UK; 3, 1 and 1 datasets, respectively), and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand; 1 and 2 datasets, respectively; Figure 3)."

1a,"Based on our research question, we have developed a simplified causal diagram as depicted in figure 1A to clearly define potential confounders (ie, age, sex/gender, ethnicity/race-related measures) and mediators (eg, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, physical activity) of the association between SEP and falls.25 Correspondingly, we have placed restrictions on the types of models and specific estimates that we will extract from different study types, to ensure that we extract data from the most appropriate models and to avoid table 2 fallacy by not interpreting statistical estimates of secondary variables from multivariable models (eg, confounders, effect modifiers).26 For studies that specifically aimed to examine the association between SEP and falls, both unadjusted and the most appropriately adjusted models (confounder-adjusted models that do not include mediators) will be extracted."

Clinically significant differences in ΔSDLP, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) crossing +2.4 cm (equivalent to driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%), were shown in healthy volunteers after a single evening dose of zopiclone 7.5 mg in all (10/10) studies (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Of the three studies that also measured ΔSDLP after a second dose of zopiclone a week later (Day 9), the study of lemborexant [21] showed the same result at the second time point, whereas the two studies of suvorexant [34, 35] failed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful effect of zopiclone at the second time point as the 95% CI did not cross +2.4 cm (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4 shows meta-analysis results for ΔSDLP for treatments other than zopiclone in single or multiple doses, including healthy volunteers and subjects with insomnia or prior use of hypnotics."
ALL_PANELS,Confidence intervals for individual studies may vary from those reported by study authors as they are based on z-statistic.Flunitrazepam 2 mg was only studied in patients with insomnia and showed clinically meaningful changes in ΔSDLP in two out of three studies (Figure 4).
ALL_PANELS,"The other treatment studied in patients with insomnia, zolpidem IR, showed no clinically meaningful effect on ΔSDLP (Figure 4)."

With numerous effects of visual context on real-time language processing (Spivey, 2007), the schematic box-and-arrow models in Figure 2 might need to be enhanced with yet another arrow, connecting the visual system to the language system.Language Comprehension Influences Visual Perception
Eberhard et al.’s (1995) results of anticipatory reference resolution contributed to the evidence for predictive processing as a fundamental component in theories of real-time language comprehension (e.g., Elman, 1990; Dikker & Pylkkänen, 2013; Kamide, Altmann, & Haywood, 2003; Ryskin, Ng, Mimnaugh, Brown-Schmidt, & Federmeier, 2020) – even if these “predictions” may be nothing more than the emergent result of a multiscale pattern completion process (Falandays, Nguyen, & Spivey, 2021)."
ALL_PANELS,"With vision influencing language and language influencing vision (Anderson, Chiu, Huette & Spivey, 2011), perhaps it is worthwhile to slightly modify the schematic box-and-arrow diagram from Figure 5 with a bi-directional arrow connecting the visual system and the language system together (see Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although the progression from Figures 1, 2 and 5 to Figure 6 could give one the impression that we should take an existing model of language processing and an existing model of visual processing and simply connect them, that is surely not the optimal solution."
ALL_PANELS,"Importantly, as we continue to see arrows added to this old-fashioned diagram (e.g., Figure 6), it can start to look like the arrows might be “doing more work” than the boxes are (see Onnis & Spivey, 2012)."
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tab
With numerous effects of linguistic context on real-time visual processing (Spivey, 2007), the schematic box-and-arrow model in Figure 5 might need to update the arrow connecting the visual system and the language system to be bi-directional.Embodied Cognition
When the arrows are explaining more of the phenomena than the boxes are, the late great Guy Van Orden referred to this as interaction-dominant dynamics (Van Orden, Holden, & Turvey, 2003)."
ALL_PANELS,He contrasted it with the component-dominant dynamics of traditional linear feedforward modular models of cognition (recall Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"This is exactly what one would expect if the function of the language system was not isolable from the function of the visual system (e.g., Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, Figure 7 modifies Figure 6 by removing the pretense that language, vision and action processes have any kind of crisp discrete boundaries that delineate them from one another."
ALL_PANELS,"There are still more coupling processes (i.e., arrows) internal to the language-like capacity in Figure 7 than there are coupling processes that connect it to the other capacities."
ALL_PANELS,The schematic diagram in Figure 7 can be softly assembled to reshape the system so that it is temporarily dedicated to one type of task or another.
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, in Figure 8, the system has softly (temporarily) assembled itself into functioning mostly as a sensorimotor processing system by boosting the coupling of its vision and action processes and damping the coupling of the language processes."
ALL_PANELS,"Compare that soft assembly with the one in Figure 9, where the system has softly (temporarily) assembled itself into functioning mostly as a visuolinguistic processing system by boosting the coupling of some of its vision and language processes and damping the coupling of the action processes."
ALL_PANELS,This schematic depiction of a soft-assembly might be for a cognitive system that is engaged in catching an American football while leaping in the air (or perhaps catching a bar of soap that’s trying to escape in the shower).Figure 9.
ALL_PANELS,"Rather than treating language as something for which the brain has dedicated processors that are hard-wired to function a certain way (e.g., Figure 1B), perhaps we should treat language as something that emerges from the self-organization capabilities of some brains-and-bodies performing actions together in a particular environment (e.g., Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"I have traced the epistemic progression from box-and-arrow diagrams of cognition that prevented context effects (Figure 1) to box-and-arrow diagrams that allow context effects (Figures 2, 5 and 6) and eventually to “arrows-and-arrows” diagrams that not only embrace context effects but even encourage the occasional blurring of the distinctions between traditional cognitive faculties (Figures 7–9)."
ALL_PANELS,"This essay began by noting that box-and-arrow models have given way to “a few slightly different theoretical approaches that all readily incorporate immediate context effects.” Three of those theoretical approaches are worth noting here: Bayesian models, dynamical system theory, and artificial neural networks (Figure 10)."
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tab
These three slightly different theoretical frameworks operating at the cutting edge of contemporary cognitive science all can be seen as interactive frameworks that combine many contextual factors at once to convert sensory input into mental states and/or actions. (A) Bayesian approaches emphasize static internal mental representations that have probabilities associated with them. (B) Dynamical systems approaches emphasize temporally dynamic trajectories on a state-space manifold that may include both neural and non-neural parameters. (C) Neural network approaches emphasize roughly neurally plausible simulations of the relationships between sensory input, cognitive processes, and motor output.Rather than being adversaries, these different theoretical frameworks can, in principle, cooperate with one another in scientifically identifying the coherent bundle of internal causal forces that make a cognitive process warrant its own label (instead of relying on folk psychology), and also in determining how weakly or strongly one cognitive process influences another (see the bundles of arrows with labels in Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Abstractly depicted at the top of Figure 11, we can imagine how individual minds (the pentagonal shapes) might fit together to form a social group."
ALL_PANELS,The pentagonal shapes at the social level of analysis (top of Figure 11) need not be made of smaller pentagonal shapes at the cognitive level; and those micro-pentagonal shapes wouldn’t need to be made of nano-pentagonal shapes at the neural level.
ALL_PANELS,"Essentially, those “puzzle pieces” in Figure 11 had better be able to combine in ways that can indeed form one of those “asymmetric pentagons” above them."
ALL_PANELS,"Essentially, if one’s theory says that the puzzle pieces in Figure 11 are made of sub-elements that do not look or behave at all like hexagons, then that theory about puzzle pieces might be impossible."
ALL_PANELS,"And thus, as suggested back in Figure 7, perhaps our models (and even Figure 11 itself) should be made entirely of arrows (relations), with no closed polygons (objects) at all."
ALL_PANELS,"In the 1990s, the cognitive and neural sciences began reporting a wide variety of context effects suggesting that the subsystems in Figure 1 are not as modular as once thought."

ALL_PANELS,The cell cycle (Figure 1) is the sequence of events leading to the production of two daughter cells from a single parent cell; it involves deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and the division of the cell through processes of mitosis.
ALL_PANELS,The endoscopic examination revealed a separation of the squamocolumnar junction and the gastroesophageal junction along with color changes from glossy white to salmon pink (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,"This bacterium thrives in an anaerobic environment and has a predilection for the pilosebaceous unit of the skin, leading to epidermal inflammation and scarring, as seen in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"Possible triggers of sarcoidosis include infectious agents, organic particles, and inorganic environmental factors, as shown in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 3, changes in the commensal gut bacteria and impairment of the intestinal luminal mucosa and epithelium due to disruption of tight junctions are the main implicating factors in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis."
ALL_PANELS,"With the acceptance of KJWHN, Korea now ranks fourth among countries in terms of MEDLINE journals in the nursing category, a position it shares with Scotland (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, out of the 22 PMC journals and 140 MEDLINE journals, the following five are indexed in both databases: Investigación y educación en enfermerías, published in Colombia; International Journal of Community based Nursing and Midwifery, published in Iran; Korean Journal of Women Health Nursing, published in Korea; Curationis, published in South Africa; and Nursing Open, published in the United States (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The most used mode of dissemination of research findings was through journal publications (n=125, 24.8%) followed by conference/workshop presentations (n=110, 21.8%) Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"This is supported by the extremely narrow intervals around the cumulative incidence estimates (Figure 2; see grey areas around the curves) which imply that, under widely differing assumptions about the true rate of out-of-care mortality, our observations outlined in the previous section (which did not consider the unknown mortality after a gap in care) were quite robust to potential under-ascertainment of mortality as a competing risk for re-engagement in care with the adjusted hazard ratios falling in the range of 1.96 to 2.03 between successful outreach and no outreach (analyses not shown)."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in
Figure 1, there are three peaks for the AAS; the highest is observed in February with a mean AAS of 1076.5 (±614.6), the second highest peak is in October with a mean AAS of 831.4 (±441.9), and the third peak is in June with a mean AAS of 586.2 (±271.1)."

Open in a new tabFirst, the datasets considered have different spatial resolution and coverage, and few studies have so far considered the whole range of displacements occurring between ∼10 and 107 m (10000 km) (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Previous studies with comparable spatial coverage (Fig 2) relied on single-transportation modality data [8], unevenly sampled data [16], or small samples (32 individuals in Ref. [5])."
ALL_PANELS,"We find that P(Δr) is best described by a log-normal distribution (Eq (1)) with parameters μ = 6.78 ± 0.07 and σ = 2.45 ± 0.04, which maximises Akaike Information Criterion (see Methods)—among the three models considered—with Akaike weight ∼1 (Fig 3, see also S1 File)."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig 4 reports the histogram of the individual μ parameters for the 96.2% of the population that is best described by a log-normal distribution, along with three examples of individual distributions."
ALL_PANELS,"The best model describing the distribution of waiting times over all individuals is the log-normal distribution (Eq (1), Fig 5, see also S1 File), with parameters μ = −0.42 ± 0.04, σ = 2.14 ± 0.02."
ALL_PANELS,"As in the case of displacements, we find that restricting the analysis to large values of our observable Δt, and specifically considering only Δt > Δt∗ = 13 h, results in the selection of the Pareto distribution (Eq (2), see Fig 5), with coefficient β = 1.44 ± 0.01."
ALL_PANELS,"We find that the distribution of distances between consecutive discoveries P(Δr) is best described as a log-normal distribution with parameters μ = 6.59 ± 0.02, σ = 1.99 ± 0.01, (Fig 6, see also S1 File)."

ALL_PANELS,"Our studies are not only the first to investigate the link between dark traits and epistemic beliefs, but also to propose a model taking into account the complex interactions between dark traits, epistemic beliefs and political orientation as well as their collective effect on COVID‐19–related cognitions and behavior (for an overview, see Figure 1)."
2b,"Furthermore, Faith in Intuition for Facts and Need for Evidence predicted COVID‐19 protective behavior (Figure 2b)."
3a,"Importantly, we found a significant overall interaction effect of political orientation: The positive association between D and the endorsement of COVID‐19 conspiracy theories increased with a more right‐wing political orientation, B = .12; SEB = .05, 95%CI [.02; .23], p = .024 (see Figure 3a)."

ALL_PANELS,"Since  pl-secSUMO* plasmid contains an upstream gp67 secretion signal of the SUMO* fusion which results in secretion of the SUMO*-rNS1 into the cell culture medium (Fig. 1), only culture supernatant of Sf21 cells was harvested on day 3 post infection."
2a,"SUMO*-DENV-4 NS1 fusion protein expressed was the correct conformation of DENV NS1
Affinity purified SUMO*-DENV-4 NS1 fusion protein expressed in Sf21 cells appeared as a monomer (~ 62 kDa) and a dimer (~ 120 kDa) in 12% SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions, respectively (Fig. 2A)."
2b,"Also, appearance of a single band on 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B) confirmed the purity of the SUMO*-NS1 fusion protein."
2a,"Affinity purified SUMO*-DENV-4 NS1 fusion protein expressed in Sf21 cells appeared as a monomer (~ 62 kDa) and a dimer (~ 120 kDa) in 12% SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions, respectively (Fig. 2A)."
ALL_PANELS,"Western blot analysis of supernatants from the six clones after SDS-PAGE separation of SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 protein as well as unfused commercial DENV-4 rNS1s revealed that the binding affinity of the three MAbs (3H7A9, 6D4B10, 8A6F2) was to the linear epitopes on both monomeric and dimeric DENV-4 NS1 isoforms (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,Results from these three assays including western blot assay indicated the MAbs are capable of binding with relatively higher affinity to DENV-4 NS1 dimeric and hexameric isoforms (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3).
ALL_PANELS,"However, 3H7A9 had a relatively lower affinity (Fig. 4) and was not utilized for development of our NS1 capture assay."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the limit of detection (LOD) curves, shown in Fig. 6, a matched pair 8A6F2/biotinylated 6D4B10 had the lowest LOD (32.5 ng/ml) while a matched pair 6D4B10/B-8A6F2 was not robust to capture and/or detect DENV-4 rNS1 even at a higher concentration (Fig. 6b)."
1a,"The student population included in this report is as follows: Honors (30 students), 56.7% White, 3.3% Black or African American, 36.7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3.3% Hispanic/Latino, 0% Multicultural; Non-Honors (39 students), 40% White, 12.5% Black or African American, 27.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, 12.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5% Multicultural, 2.5% Not reporting (Figure 1A)."
1b,"Most were in their second year of college, though the honors section had more who were classified as juniors, likely due to more credits completed rather than being in the third year of college (Figure 1B)."
ALL_PANELS,Student responses frequently referenced the neuroscience of bias (Figure 2) and racism as a public health issue (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Twenty-two of 29 students in the honors section discussed the neuroscience of bias while 25 of 39 in the regular section did.Figure 3.
ALL_PANELS,"About 76 percent of students in the honors section, and 64 percent of students in the regular section referred to the neuroscience of bias (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,The majority of students in both honors (51.7%) and regular (59%) sections of the course indicated awareness of the negative impacts of racism on determinants of health (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,"No student chose the response “Disagree” or “Strongly Disagree” so those choices were excluded from the representation for ease of reading.Students Responded Positively to This Module

ALL_PANELS,"In the EEG neurophysiological analysis, a total of 6 subjects were excluded: from group MC, 1 subject was excluded due to equipment issues and 1 other subject for not completing the study (the same subject as before); and from group CM, 1 subject was excluded due to equipment issues, 1 subject due to experimental error, and 2 subjects due to their EEG data containing too many artifacts to perform the offline analysis.Experimental design
The experimental design is illustrated in Figure 1."
1a,"Session 1 part 1 contains 8 runs: 4 runs of a one-dimensional (1D) left-right (LR) cursor control task and 4 runs of a 1D up-down (UD) cursor control task (Figure 1A), of which the first run in both tasks were practice runs."
1c,"Afterward, in session 1 part 2, subjects repeated the same 6 runs of the BCI tasks as before the intervention—3 runs of LR followed by 3 runs of UD (Figure 1C)."
1b,"2 s after this “target” appeared, a pink circle, or the “cursor,” appeared at the center of the monitor (Figure 1B)."
ALL_PANELS,"The plots (Figure 4) seem to show a general increase in performance improvement as the interval between sessions increases, with the Spearman correlation coefficients being 0.634 for the LR (p = 0.049) and 0.276 for the UD task (p = 0.440), respectively."
ALL_PANELS,"Interestingly, Figure 4 shows a somewhat increasing trend between the change in BCI performance (PVC, %) and the interval between the two sessions (days)."
ALL_PANELS,"By administering high concentration oxygen and performing T1 mapping, areas of hypoxia can be identified from a lack of decrease in T1 times (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Following screening, 49 articles were identified for qualitative analysis consisting of 34 journal articles and15 conference abstracts (Figure 2, full list of results in Appendix 2)."
ALL_PANELS,The distribution of the journal articles and published conference abstracts by publication year is shown in Figure 3.

ALL_PANELS,EFSA screens the respective TUs and chooses which ones are to be included in the ongoing Panel Statement to be considered for the QPS list (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,"For TUs initially not included in the QPS list, but for which a new recommendation for that list is provided from the process described in Figure 2, the inclusion in the list may still be considered for the risk assessment process of that specific EFSA Unit."

ALL_PANELS,"This distance causes the spatial resolution of the USV to be very low as illustrated in Figure 2 implicating that fiducial markers encoding full pose (e.g., AprilTag) would not be visible."
ALL_PANELS,An example of the relative pose influence on the brightness is when the object that faces the UAS with its non-illuminated side changes its pose in a way that it now faces the UAS with its sun illuminated side as shown in Figure 4.
ALL_PANELS,Another example is when the sun is in the field of view of the UAS's camera causing the white balance distortion in the video frames as can be seen in Figure 5.

Object's blob brightness may vary significantly in the video frames F(t) with varying t because of the outdoor environmental conditions.Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,"If the object moves away from the UAS, its size will decrease and vice versa as can be seen in Figure 6."
ALL_PANELS,"Taking a cylindrical object such as a USV as an example, if such object is facing toward the UAS, its blob will be circular (inertia ratio will be high), however, If it is turned sideways, its blob will be elliptical (inertia ratio will be low) as shown in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,"In the extreme case, the object's blob might be featureless due to the large distance between the object and the UAS causing the spatial resolution might be very low as illustrated in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,This problem can be alleviated by using Gaussian blur convolution filter to diffuse the color of the smaller color blobs into the bigger color blobs as illustrated in Figure 9.
ALL_PANELS,"The Gaussian filter can be applied by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel as follows:

ALL_PANELS,An example of a binary threshold map after the application of erosion and dilation can be seen on the right side of Figure 11.
ALL_PANELS,"The result is a greyscale map of the same dimensions as F(t), where each pixel's value signifies how much this pixel's hue is represented in the histogram as shown in Figure 12."
ALL_PANELS,The algorithm eventually converges to a local maximum density area and tracks it as can be seen in Figure 12.
ALL_PANELS,This is illustrated in Figure 2 where a USV's blob is circular making it hard to estimate the orientation by shape analysis.
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the camera may face the sun distorting white balance in the entire view as can be seen in Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,Another example is presented in Figure 4 illustrating how significantly can illumination conditions change during a single run.
ALL_PANELS,The aggressive and lytic nature of the tumor can lead to varying degrees of vertebral compression ranging from mild to outright vertebral plana (Figure 1).

1a,"Taken together, our data demonstrate the importance of rapidly and openly sharing science in the context of a global pandemic and the essential role of preprints in this endeavour.Results
COVID-19 preprints were posted early in the pandemic and represent a significant proportion of the COVID-19 literature
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe, from 3 patients in the city of Wuhan on the December 27, 2019 to over 46.1 million confirmed cases worldwide by the end of October 2020 (Fig 1A)."
1b,"The scientific community responded rapidly as soon as COVID-19 emerged as a serious threat, with publications appearing within weeks of the first reported cases (Fig 1B)."
1b,"By the end of April 2020, over 19,000 scientific publications had appeared, published both in scientific journals (12,679; approximately 65%) and on preprint servers (6,710; approximately 35%) (Fig 1B)—in some cases, preprints had already been published in journals during this time period and thus contribute to the counts of both sources."
"c, d","COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019; WHO, World Health Organization.The 30,260 manuscripts posted as preprints were hosted on a range of preprint servers covering diverse subject areas not limited to biomedical research (Fig 1C, data from [15])."
1c,"Despite being one of the newest preprint servers, medRxiv hosted the largest number of preprints (7,882); the next largest were SSRN (4,180), Research Square (4,089), RePEc (2,774), arXiv (2,592), bioRxiv (2,328), JMIR (1,218), and Preprints.org (1,020); all other preprint servers were found to host <1,000 preprints (Fig 1C)."
"a, s","In total, 44,503 preprints were deposited to bioRxiv and medRxiv in this period, of which the majority (34,271, 77.0%) were non-COVID-19–related preprints (Fig 2A, S1 Table)."
2b,"A minor but detectable difference was observed between screening time for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 2B), although this difference appeared to vary with server (2-way ANOVA, interaction term; F1,83333 = 19.22, p < 0.001)."
2c,"The majority of preprints existed as only a single version for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 works, with very few preprints existing in more than 2 versions (Fig 2C)."
2d,"License choice was significantly associated with preprint category (chi-squared, χ2 = 336.0, df = 5, p < 0.001); authors of COVID-19 preprints were more likely to choose the more restrictive CC-BY-NC-ND or CC-BY-ND than those of non-COVID-19 preprints and less likely to choose CC-BY (Fig 2D)."
2e,"To investigate this, we compared the word counts and reference counts of COVID-19 preprints and non-COVID-19 preprints from bioRxiv (at the time of data extraction, HTML full texts from which word and reference counts were derived were not available for medRxiv) (Fig 2E)."
2f,"COVID-19 preprints also contain fewer references than non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 2F), although not fewer than expected relative to overall preprint length, as little difference was detected in reference:word count ratios (median, 1:103 versus 1:101; p = 0.052)."
3a,"Although little difference was seen in number of authors between preprint servers (S1 Table), COVID-19 preprints had a marginally higher number of authors than non-COVID-19 preprints on average (median, 7 [IQR 8] versus 6 [IQR 5]; p < 0.001), due to the greater likelihood of large (11+) authorship team sizes (Fig 3A)."
3a,"However, single-author preprints were approximately 2.6 times more common for COVID-19 (6.1% of preprints) than non-COVID-19 preprints (2.3% of preprints) (Fig 3A)."
3b,"COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019.The largest proportion of preprints in our dataset were from corresponding authors in the United States, followed by significant proportions from the United Kingdom and China (Fig 3B)."
3d,"Moreover, we found that most countries posted their first COVID-19 preprint close to the time of their first confirmed COVID-19 case (Fig 3D), with weak positive correlation considering calendar days of both events (Spearman rank; ρ = 0.54, p < 0.001)."
3e,"For example, some authors that previously posted preprints in evolutionary biology have posted COVID-19 preprints in microbiology (Fig 3E)."
4a,"As expected, greater proportions published were seen among preprints posted earlier, with over 40% of COVID-19 preprints submitted in January published by the end of October and less than 10% for those published in August or later (Fig 4A)."
4b,"Published COVID-19 preprints were distributed across many journals, with clinical or multidisciplinary journals tending to publish the most COVID-19 preprints (Fig 4B)."
4c,"This did not appear to be driven by any temporal changes in publishing practices, as the distribution of publication times for non-COVID-19 preprints was similar to our control time frame of January to December 2019 (Fig 4C)."
4d,"This acceleration additionally varied between publishers (2-way ANOVA, interaction term preprint type*publisher; F9,5273 = 6.58, p < 0.001) and was greatest for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) at an average difference of 102 days (Tukey HSD; p < 0.001) (Fig 4D)."
ALL_PANELS,"COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019.Extensive access of preprint servers for COVID-19 research
At the start of our time window, COVID-19 preprints received abstract views at a rate over 18 times that of non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 5A) (time-adjusted negative binomial regression; rate ratio = 18.2, z = 125.0, p < 0.001) and downloads at a rate of almost 30 times (Fig 5B) (rate ratio = 27.1, z = 124.2, p < 0.001)."
ALL_PANELS,The disparity between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints suggests that either COVID-19 preprints continued to slowly accumulate total usage well beyond their first month online (Fig 5) and/or they received a more diluted share of relative initial interest as larger volumes of preprints (and publications) were available by later months (Fig 1B).
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, the need to rapidly communicate findings prior to a lengthy review process might be responsible for this observation (Fig 3)."
2b,"An analysis of publication timelines for 14 medical journals has shown that some publishers have taken steps to accelerate their publishing processes for COVID-19 research, reducing the time for the peer-review stage (submission to acceptance) on average by 45 days and the editing stage (acceptance to publication) by 14 days [29], yet this still falls some way short of the approximately 1 to 3 days screening time for bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints (Fig 2B)."
ALL_PANELS,These more formal projects partly account for the increased commenting on the most high-profile COVID-19 preprints (Fig 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Usage data (abstract views and PDF downloads) were scraped from the bioRxiv and medRxiv public web pages using the rvest package for R [50]. bioRxiv and medRxiv web pages display abstract views and PDF downloads on a calendar month basis; for subsequent analysis (e.g., Fig 4), these were summed to generate total abstract views and downloads since the time of preprint posting."

ALL_PANELS,"Overview of DSLP laboratories
DLSP current activities take place in three KEMRI laboratories, one in Kisumu and two in Nairobi (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"In Kenya, DGHP has supported investigations into outbreaks of respiratory diseases (e.g., influenza, pertussis), diarrheal diseases (e.g., cholera, Salmonella Typhi, shigellosis), aflatoxicosis, and vector-borne diseases (e.g., Zika, dengue, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever viruses) (Fig. 3) [9, 22–27]."
ALL_PANELS,Arrows represent implementation of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and TaqMan Array Card (TAC)Fig. 3.
ALL_PANELS,"The complete number of outbreaks and training performed in the region is summarized in Fig. 4.Development of new diagnostic technology to detect emerging and re-emerging pathogens
The diagnostic capacity in DLSP laboratories has been augmenting annually since 2004."
ALL_PANELS,"To date DLSP, across its three participating laboratories, is capable of testing for 153 different pathogens by rRT-PCR, serological assays, microscopy, bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence and TAC. (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Within 3 years, the project will expand to include an additional 8 counties with improved capacity in microbiology techniques, AMR, specimen referral and shipping (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"As of 2016, NPHLS NIC has successfully assumed diagnostic testing responsibility for 2 of the 5 influenza sentinel surveillance sites in the country (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Over the last decade DLSP trained technical staff from Kenya and neighboring countries in PCR, ELISA and microbiology diagnostic techniques to detect multiple pathogens (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"This capacity was recently recognized by the newly established African Centers of Disease Control which has designated Kenya as a regional collaborating center, to support disease prevention and outbreak response throughout the region.Acknowledgements

ALL_PANELS,"This pattern, summarized in Figure 7, indicates task-induced agentic emotion of positive and negative valence are not mutually exclusive and can co-occur in healthy individuals (Beebe-Center, 1965).Agentic traits
Exuberance and agentic anger responses were specifically predicted by participants’ trait SP, a measure of trait agency and reward sensitivity, and were – in contrast – wholly unrelated to multiple other traits present in the study participants, including traits of impulsivity, aggression, anxiety, affiliation, fear, and immersive emotion (Table 3 and Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,Our findings further suggest trait SP and inducibility of states of exuberance may provide novel markers for the capacity for agentic anger in young adults (Figure 7).
ALL_PANELS,"These data indicate a role of social leadership in agentic anger experience, and its psychometric independence from aggression, hostility, and intent to harm (Table 3 and Figure 7).Agentic behavior
Our preliminary findings indicate agentic anger and exuberance responses predicted the voluntary approach of risky rewards (‘active risk-taking’)."
ALL_PANELS,"Agentic anger and exuberance may thus facilitate voluntary approach (and engagement with) risky rewards (Figure 7) through different antecedent processes, with potential for differential follow-on effects."
ALL_PANELS,"These preliminary findings have relevance for motivation of personal and group action in pursuit of social justice: a timeless, difficult and uncertain goal that entails significant risk of harm for activists in a wide range of contexts (Friston, 2012; Bacchetti, 2013; Button et al., 2013; Quinlan, 2013).Future directions
Future work on agentic anger and other negatively valenced agentic states (Figure 7) will benefit from inclusion of additional measures such as courage, indignation, righteousness, rage, and moral injury, which were not evaluated in the present studies."
ALL_PANELS,"The findings may also have relevance to a fuller understanding of agency and anger in real-world contexts, such as Title VII employment discrimination and the legal system (see Carle, 2005, 2016).Summary and conclusions
In sum, the present studies provide two lines of preliminary proof-of-concept evidence for the agentic properties of anger and other negatively valenced states in healthy humans (Table 1 and Figure 7)."

"a, b","The surface roughness of the fibre may be affected by the fibre extraction methods, and particularly the quality of the retting process (Figure 1a,b)."
ALL_PANELS,"The size of the lumen may represent only a small part of the cross-sectional area, as in the case of flax (Figure 1c) and hemp, or in contrast it may represent a significant part for kenaf and wood (Figure 1d,e) [27]."
1c,"As far as plant-derived fibres are concerned, their cross-section is generally polygonal, as evidenced for flax in Figure 1c."
1c,"Such cross-sections make it possible to achieve high fibre volume fractions within plant structures (see Figure 1c), such as stems."

ALL_PANELS,"Francucci et al. [13] have also observed such irreversible transverse cell wall deformation in compacted woven jute fabrics, and this phenomenon increased as the fibre content increased (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"This is in stark contrast with the observation of Lundquist et al. [40] (Figure 3), where all wood pulp lumen had collapsed by vf = 69%, and the wood pulp random mat was compressed further up to vf = 90%."
ALL_PANELS,Permeability can be experimentally measured by tracking the progression of the fluid flow front and monitoring the pressure field (Figure 5).
"c, d","However, a 2D radial flow achieved through central injection (Figure 5c,d) may be more appropriate for anisotropic reinforcements to quickly measure anisotropy in permeability."
5b,"The flow front can be tracked manually (e.g., with scale bars, as in Figure 5b), with a video camera, or through pressure sensors."
ALL_PANELS,"For a demonstration, Figure 6a shows the linear relationship between the square of the flow front position and the fill time for two separate infusion conditions; the slope of the curve x2/t is used as an input in Equation (3) to determine Kunsat.

(b) Plot of saturated and unsaturated permeability against porosity (= 1 – fibre volume fraction) (related to the Carman–Kozeny equation).The saturated and unsaturated permeability can then be determined over various conditions, for example varying fabric porosities (or fibre volume fraction), as shown in Figure 6b."
ALL_PANELS,"Indeed, such concerns have been voiced in studies on the mould filling process of plant fibre reinforcements as well (Figure 7) [6,23,24,25]."
ALL_PANELS,"As Figure 8 highlights, at low flow velocities (and high fibre volume fractions) capillary flow dominates, leading to inter-yarn voids, while at high flow velocities (and low fibre volume fractions) viscous flow dominates, leading to intra-yarn voids."
ALL_PANELS,"Both effects have been shown for plant fibre composites (Figure 8) as a function of the fibre volume fraction [41,63]."
ALL_PANELS,This argument is further strengthened by the fact that the difference between the saturated and unsaturated permeability vanishes with increasing porosity (decreasing fibre volume fraction) (Figure 6).
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 2, plant fibre preforms experience all the compaction mechanisms that synthetic fibre preforms experience (described in Table 1), but not vice versa."

P
) for COVID‐19 works posted on preprint servers in July 2020 is 51.5 versus 112.8 days, respectively."
ALL_PANELS,"The latter explains our observation of negative pre‐submission delays for early bird manuscripts (Fig. 1), an indication that their authors prefer posting them on preprint servers after their submission to journals, likely, in an attempt to avoid scooping (Anderson, 2019); for example, among the most recently posted preprints (1 February–31 March 2021), 51% have t

1a,"Protein Phosphatase 2A is a large family of Serine/Threonine phosphatases consisting of three main subunits—PP2A-A, PP2A-B, and PP2A-C—that form an active trimeric holoenzyme that dephosphorylates substrate proteins (Fig. 1A; refs."
3a,"Sensor, transducer, and effector proteins (from Fig. 3A schematic) were analyzed in OV81, PEO-1, and PEO-C42."
"f, g","Using similar rescue experiments as for 766, we demonstrated that SMAP-061–mediated effects were directly dependent on PP2A modulation (Fig. 5F and G)."
5h,"Calyculin-A rescues cell death by 40% at SMAP-061’s highest concentration (40 µmol/L), which alone leads to 100% cell death (Fig. 5H)."
5f,"We observed that for all three cell lines, SMAP-061 activity is effectively impaired by Calyculin-A preincubation, as observed by the cell death markers and RAD51 protein expression rescue (Fig. 5F)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our studies introduce a unique mechanism of synthetic lethality, through a small-molecule mediator of PP2A that potently reduces RAD51 expression, leading to concomitant apoptosis (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, further studies are necessary to assess the mechanism by which PP2A and SMAP-061 regulate RAD51 (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"This is known as the context, mechanism and outcomes configuration (CMOC).49 The ontological core of realism is that the real, whether that is physical or social, exists independently of our knowledge of it;50 however, we can come to know them by observing sequences of events and identifying the mechanisms which give rise to different outcomes.50

Realist research is theory driven, with the unit of analysis being the programme theory rather than programme activities.48 In realist research, the programme is seen as a dynamic mini-system within a larger complex social world.50 The enquiry of the research is to build and then test an account, or accounts, of how and why an intervention works.50

When reporting on this realist synthesis, we shall follow the steps outlined in RAMESES (Realist and MEta-Narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards) guide for meta-narrative synthesis.51

ALL_PANELS,"While it may be impossible to measure the true impact of individual journal articles on a profession, altmetrics can provide insight into the influence of articles in the JMLA on the field of health sciences librarianship and information science by showing how frequently they are read and discussed online (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,Our systematic search of the literature is depicted in more detail in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 1, the workflow started by collecting journal articles from June to August 2022, excluding irrelevant and incompletely published studies, and performing bibliometric analyses."
ALL_PANELS,"Research Framework
The research framework illustrates the analysis results based on scale, time, space, and composition. “Scale” includes descriptive and LDA analyses. “Time” refers to the analysis of the timeline of the 104 studies. “Space” refers to the distribution of research capacity analyzed by country. “Composition” refers to the network visualization analysis (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 3, the earliest studies on intervention programs—“technological intervention,” “social support,” and “medical intervention”—emerged in 2014, based on analyses and screenings."
ALL_PANELS,"China had the highest research volume in terms of articles on smartphone addiction published in international academic journals, followed by South Korea, Taiwan, Spain, the UK, the US, India, Canada, Hong Kong, Iran, Australia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, the Caucasus region, France, the Hebrew region, Lebanon, Tunisia, the Philippines, Switzerland, Nigeria, Germany, Bangladesh, Oman, Sudan, Austria, Palestine, Vienna, Germany, Switzerland, Peru, and Brazil (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 5 illustrates the citation structure relationships among studies and indicates that the research of intervention programs for smartphone addiction is recognized by many academic journals and that they are interconnected in this field.
ALL_PANELS,"The visualization analysis depicted in Figure 5 shows clusters around lead researchers in the field, indicating that their research has a high degree of association with others."

ALL_PANELS,Figure 8 shows that certain keywords are intimately related to the intervention of smartphone addiction and represent related phenomena in that domain.
ALL_PANELS,Figure 1 illustrates this with a toy simulation of a set of studies testing a difference between means from two conditions.
ALL_PANELS,"When dealing with probabilistic phenomena, a Bayesian approach makes more sense, whereby we consider the accumulated evidence to determine the relative likelihood of one hypothesis over another (as illustrated in Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"About the same (that is, within 5% of each other)

Most people selected Option 3, whereas, as illustrated in Figure 3, Option 2 is the correct answer—with only 15 births per day, the day-to-day variation in the proportion of boys will be much higher than with 45 births per day, and hence, more days will have more than 60% boys."

ALL_PANELS,According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020; relevant information was extracted from specified publications (Fig. 1) (10).
ALL_PANELS,"Sources of uncertainty were identified systematically in all parts of the assessment, starting from the planning stage (step B in Figure 5 of EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018a)."
ALL_PANELS,"The analysis was divided into parts on three levels, corresponding to the structure of the hazard assessment, as illustrated in the upper part of Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"For each of the 21 clusters in the other HOCs, uncertainty was quantified by means of two quantitative expert judgements, comprising a third level of division in the uncertainty analysis, as illustrated in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"Assessment of clusters by expert judgement

The two questions for each cluster (see Figure 1) were assessed by expert judgement."
ALL_PANELS,"After a screening for the reliability and relevance of the results, six studies from four publications, all ranked as of limited relevance, were selected for further consideration (Figure 3 and Table 15)."
ALL_PANELS,The overview of the evaluation and the summary of the test results from the 22 studies are reported in Figure 4.
ALL_PANELS,The overview of the evaluation and the summary of the test results from the 21 studies are reported in Figure 5 and in Table 16.
ALL_PANELS,"The methods used to quantify the combined impact of the uncertainties affecting the hazard characterisation for HOCs other than genotoxicity are described in Section 2.3.4.1, in which an overview of the approach is provided in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"The cpfs for the 21 clusters were then combined to produce overall cpfs quantifying uncertainty about the estimated lowest BMD across all the 21 clusters, as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 in Section 2.3.4.1."
ALL_PANELS,"These revised judgements were used to produce revised overall cpfs quantifying uncertainty about the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters, which are shown in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,The horizontal axis of Figure 7 shows the range of doses in which the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters is considered to lie.
ALL_PANELS,Thus Figure 7 can be used to derive probabilities for the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters being either above or below the RP.
ALL_PANELS,"The black dashed curves in Figure 7 are lower and upper bounds for the overall enveloped cpf, which reflect the combined effect of differences between experts in their judgements on each cluster."
ALL_PANELS,"The red solid curves in Figure 7 are lower and upper bounds for the overall averaged cpf, for which the cpfs of different experts for the same cluster are combined by averaging, giving equal weight to each expert."
ALL_PANELS,"The vertical blue dotted line in Figure 7 marks the dose corresponding to the RP (8.2 ng BPA/kg bw per day, expressed as HED) and the horizontal blue dotted lines show four estimates of the cumulative probability for this dose, i.e. the probability that the lowest BMD across all 21 clusters is below the RP."
ALL_PANELS,The results in Figure 7 are an estimate of the combined impact of those uncertainties which were considered by the experts when making judgements on each of the 21 clusters included in the preceding steps.
ALL_PANELS,"The outcome of this analysis is shown by the cumulative probability functions in Figure 7, which quantify uncertainty about the dose at which the lowest BMD across all clusters would lie if all the uncertainties were resolved, assessed by a structured process of expert judgement (EKE)."
ALL_PANELS,"Sensitivity analysis showed that the lowest part of the overall averaged cpf in Figure 7 (up to 5% probability on the vertical axis) was determined mainly by the cluster allergic lung inflammation and, in particular, by the study by O'Brien et al. (2014) [RefID 5462], reporting effects on production of pro‐inflammatory mediators and specific IgE in mice exposed prenatally to BPA."
ALL_PANELS,"Allergic lung inflammation was also the largest contributor to the middle part of the overall averaged cpf in Figure 7 (around 50% probability on the vertical axis), but here other clusters also contributed significantly (cellular immunity, inflammation and, to a lesser extent, male and female reproductive toxicity; see Figure D.13B in Appendix D)."
ALL_PANELS,"In the final step of the uncertainty analysis the CEP Panel assessed by expert judgement their probability that the lowest estimated BMD is below the RP, taking into account the estimates of this probability in Figure 7 and also additional uncertainties (Appendix D, Table D.5) that were not quantified earlier."
ALL_PANELS,"27


The cumulative probability functions in Figure 7 show the probability of the lowest estimated BMD being below each dose on the horizontal axis, based on the expert judgements made in the uncertainty analysis."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the lower and upper bounds for the averaged cpf in Figure 7, the probability of the lowest estimated BMD being below this dose would be between 43% and 57%, bracketing the 50% probability that would apply to a median estimate, as shown by the green solid lines in the figure."
ALL_PANELS,"Raw data for Figure 8, Panel E, could not be assessed as they were not included in the publicly available data set for the study."

ALL_PANELS,"The interaction between age and the biomarker on autocorrect errors was not significant in a model with all target words (b = .07; SE = .07; χ2 =1.05. p = .307), not significant in a model with only dominant function word targets (b = .02; SE = .07; χ2 < 1), and also not significant when using total Tau or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio instead of the Tau/Aβ42 ratio (ps ≥ .31).Diagnostic utility of autocorrect errors
Figure 2 shows ROC curves and areas under the curve (AUC) for autocorrect errors on function (A) or content (B) word targets, and for comparison on standard neuropsychological tests (C) of memory (CVLT learning), executive functions (CWIT inhibition), and a neuropsychological composite score (i.e., mean z-score of all tests listed in Table 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"The AUC was significant for autocorrect errors on function word targets in dominant paragraphs (AUC = .76; SE = .07; p = .003), but not for any of the other error types or for neuropsychological measures (ps > .05; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Importantly, autocorrect errors appeared to be as sensitive as other neuropsychological test scores for identifying biomarker positive individuals (e.g., see Table 1; Figure 2), suggesting that the autocorrect task may be a useful addition to a cognitive assessment test battery."
ALL_PANELS,"While AD risk was associated with increased likelihood of autocorrection errors, it is unlikely that this is a consequence of diminished semantic processing since function word targets elicited more autocorrect errors than content word targets (see Figure 1), and function words better discriminated biomarker positive from negative individuals than content words (see Figure 2)."

"a, b, s","In general, the most frequently used journals did not have a disease-specific focus, though the most cited journal in the lung cancer dataset (Journal of Thoracic Oncology) and the two most cited in the leukemia dataset (Blood, Leukemia) are prominent publications focused on those diseases (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Tables 1,2)."
"a, b, s","While general interest journals were cited often (e.g., New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Science), publications that have a focus more specifically on cancer genetics were also frequently cited (e.g., Oncotarget, Oncogene) (Fig. 1a, b, Supplemental Tables 1,2)."
1c,"While Oncology journals were the most commonly used category, many basic science and medical specialty categories were represented (Fig. 1c)."
1d,"The publishers: Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and the American Chemical Society – accounted for 59% of the journals in our clinical interpretation dataset (Fig. 1d)."
1e,50 out of 265 journals (19%) were classified as Gold Open Access and 25% (66/265) had Delayed Open Access policies (Fig. 1e).

2a,Coverage rates were high both for the journals used in lung cancer cases and the journals used in leukemia cases (Fig. 2a).
2b,"Coverage rate was also similarly high when subscription coverage was measured in terms of number of uses from the subscribed journals rather than number of journals used, indicating that university collections did not have coverage gaps in journals that are of high value for genomics (Fig. 2b)."
2a,"As with university collections, no difference was seen in the coverage of the journals needed for lung cancer and leukemia interpretation (Fig. 2a)."
2b,We observed that coverage was somewhat higher in hospital system collections when measured by articles used from the subscribed journals than when measured by number of journals (Fig. 2b).
2c,"We found that the ratio of articles covered to journals covered was much higher for institutions with smaller subscription holdings (Fig. 2c), indicating that their collections are focused on publications with more general use."
2d,"Similarly, the average impact factor of journals in smaller holdings was also much higher, indicating a focus on general interest journals (Fig. 2d)."

What works for whom and in what circumstances in relation to practitioners supporting people living with and beyond cancer to self-manage the long-term physical and psychosocial consequences on completing systemic anticancer therapies?
Pawson et al have proposed a method for conducting realist reviews.21 However, there is freedom to interpret the method and customise the steps.22 26 29 This review is guided by five steps, adapted from Pawson et al for conducting a realist review: (1) define the review scope, (2) develop initial programme theories, (3) search for evidence, (4) select and appraise evidence and (5) extract and synthesise data.21

ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, although the page numbers were represented as “329–52” in the original reference string as depicted in Fig 4, the actual metadata field value for the page was entered as “329–352.” Therefore, it is possible that the tokens corresponding to the page were incorrectly labeled with the “O” tags or only a part of the page were correctly tagged because we used the exact string-matching approach."

5a,Initial CFD simulations of the unmodified flow field (Figure 5A) showed that the solution′s velocity vectors linearly followed the path of the flow field with minimal mixing along the z‐axis.
5a,The most turbulent portions of the unmodified flow field were at the end of each linear section (Figure 5A).
5b,"In these areas, solution would flow up or down the triangular ramp, hit the middle agitator and cause circular solution mixing (Figure 5B)."
ALL_PANELS,"To assess the techno‐economic viability of an ARS/K4[(FeCN)6] DAC process, we performed a discounted cash flow for the 10 year operation of a demonstration‐scale version of our DAC process – accounting for maintenance and periodic full replacement of the solvent system, fuel cells, and pumps (Figure 6)."

ALL_PANELS,"One method is to form a tree structure with an initial source of information depicted as the root (Figure 1; Ma et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2015)."
ALL_PANELS,"While this is interesting, the model presented in Figure 2 on the links among misinformation propagators and refuters does not really add to the overall impact of the paper, which should be based on the findings."
ALL_PANELS,"This is also clarified in the legend for Figure 2, which includes the PRISMA table describing the identification of relevant peer reviewed articles for this review."
ALL_PANELS,This includes a shortened and greatly revised description of how we think Figure 1 represents an innovative method for studying the question of the implications of social media misinformation for vaccine attitudes and behaviors.

ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4, with all other parameters held identical, a higher random-effect SD resulted in a lower power for both the within- and between-person effects in both the linear and logistic models we investigated."
ALL_PANELS,"However, as shown in Figure 2, the influence of the fixed effect intercept was found to be more salient in the small random-effect SD condition."
ALL_PANELS,"Finally, Figure 3 and Figure 5 show that the effect of varying the correlation between random effects on power was found to be minimal in both of the models."

ALL_PANELS,Videos are followed by a valence rating (indicating empathic affect sharing) and by either a question regarding the narrators mental state (for videos with ToM demand) or a factual reasoning control question (for videos without ToM demand) (see Fig. 4).
2a,"We observed a strong negative correlation between valence ratings and prosocial decisions following emotional videos (ρ = -0.62, p < 0.001), indicating that stronger experience of shared negative affect was associated with increased helping behavior (Fig. 2A)."

Employing a validated and naturalistic video-based assessment of empathy and mentalizing, we show that inducing empathy leads to a strong and reliable increase of prosocial decisions."
ALL_PANELS,"In this task (see Fig. 4), participants were presented with a short video-clip (~ 15 s.) in which a female or male narrator either told a neutral (e.g., selling items on eBay) or emotionally negative (e.g., one’s sister suffering from bowel cancer), allegedly autobiographical story that either does or does not impose ToM demand."

ALL_PANELS,"The HUC 8 highlighted in red in panel a is depicted in Figure 3.The inherent nestedness of the dataset can be used to examine the spatial pattern of confluence conditions across a range of spatial scales, from the spatial pattern for HUC 8 units across the country (Figure 2) to HUC 12 units nested in HUC 8 units (Figure 3b) to individual confluences within HUC 12 units (Figure 3a)."
ALL_PANELS,"There was often considerable spatial variability in confluences conditions within the HUC 12 units that comprise a HUC 8 (e.g., Figures 2a vs. 3b) and there was often considerable spatial variability in confluence conditions within the HUC 12 units themselves (e.g., Figure 3a vs. 3b)."
3a,"The scale of individual confluences is often the scale at which restoration occurs because of cost factors (Wickham, Riitters, et al. 2017) and an interesting example of how the data could be used to support local ecological restoration efforts is represented by the confluence encircled in black in Figure 3a."
ALL_PANELS,"The Google Earth™ image date is February 2, 2019.Across the conterminous U.S., about 20% (n = 196,818) of the confluences were hydraulically significant, and their distribution across the clusters was uneven (Figure 4)."
3a,"Depending on the objectives, our emphasis on generality may or may not impact the use of these data at local scales (e.g., Figure 3a)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our results for hydrologic significance for stream orders greater than one (i.e., Figure 4) could also be affected if the inclusion of headwaters changed the spatial pattern of stream orders."
ALL_PANELS,"The inherent nestedness of the dataset can be used to examine the spatial pattern of confluence conditions across a range of spatial scales, from the spatial pattern for HUC 8 units across the country (Figure 2) to HUC 12 units nested in HUC 8 units (Figure 3b) to individual confluences within HUC 12 units (Figure 3a)."
ALL_PANELS,"Across the conterminous U.S., about 20% (n = 196,818) of the confluences were hydraulically significant, and their distribution across the clusters was uneven (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"In order to test this, we calculated the AHS_contradiction score and grouped participants into two categories based on Median Split35,36 of AHS_contradiction score (for detailed distribution of AHS scores on the formal logic and naïve dialecticism, see the Supplementary file: Fig. 1–2): those with a formal logic thinking style and those with a naïve dialectism thinking style."
ALL_PANELS,Data for the current study were collected between February 2016 and February 2020 and represent a secondary analysis conducted on a sub-sample of the Infant Study (Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"All studies identified met the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria (see figure 1).17 We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, INSPEC, Scielo/Lilacs, Cochrane Library, Global Health, Web of Science PLUS (including Food Science and Technology Abstracts [FSTA] and BIOSIS Citation Index [BCI])."
ALL_PANELS,"This first round of screening excluded 426 articles from the review, yielding 35 articles for which full texts were obtained and assessed for whether or not implementation outcomes were described.12 19–48 Of the remaining articles, we excluded 30 during the second round of reviews for the following reasons: no implementation science outcome reported,19–30 32–42 44–48 abstracts for which we could not locate papers,34 protocol papers with missing information on the trial outcomes29 and primary outcomes not related to change in BP24 26–28 33 36 41 43 45 48 (see figure 1)."
1a,"VDR protein levels were detected in all cells, and generally were elevated following 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment, which was most pronounced in nonmalignant AA RC43N cells; RC77T cells did not change VDR expression in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1A)."
1b,"In RC43T compared with LNCaP, the basal VDR was enriched for the TF, SAFB2 and following 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment there was a gain of the NFκB CoR PPP1R13L, TRIM29 and TGFB1, and loss of PARP1 (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2)."
1c,"Next, we identified those differentially enriched proteins that were altered the most depending on genomic ancestry and oncogenic transformation (Fig. 1C)."
"a, l","The greatest 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent impact on NF and mononucleosome (mono) regions was in RC43N and RC43T (Fig. 2A, left, right)."
3b,Others nuclear receptor motifs such as NR4A1/NUR77 and PGR were common (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S6).
3c,"Again, delta enrichment values (Fig. 3C) revealed that 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment reduced motif enrichment in LNCaP, RC43N, and RC43T cells suggesting that VDR binding sites became more exclusive."
1b,"The 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent NF regions in RC43T annotated to multiple proteins that were enriched in the basal VDR complex (logPV = 26.8) including VDR and XRCC5 and given that these represent loss of NF regions it may reflect why the number of proteins in the 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated VDR complex in RC43T is much reduced compared with the basal state (Fig. 1B)."
5a,"This identified 27 altered coregulators in AA patients, and from these, five were uniquely or more significantly altered in AA compared with EA TMPRSS2 fusion negative prostate cancer (Fig. 5A)."
1a,"B, The blot used for Fig. 1A (cells treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (100 nmol/L, 24 hours) or vehicle control and total protein isolated) was stripped and reprobed with antibodies toward BAZ1A and SMARCA5."
1c,"Finally, we used partial correlation analyses to define how genomic ancestry and oncogenic transformation enriched components of the VDR complex (Fig. 1C) impacted the strength of the correlations between VDR and AA VDR ChIP-seq annotated genes in AA tumors, or EA VDR ChIP-seq annotated genes in EA tumors."

The Matanuska-Susitna basin ICI and IWI results were correlated at r = 0.5759."
ALL_PANELS,The largest increase to the value of an individual catchment was 0.1678 and the largest increase to an individual watershed was 0.2647 (see Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Areas incurring the greatest stress were in the rapidly developing Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the ICI scores for catchments along the largely unpaved and unpopulated Denali Highway had some of the largest increases (Figure 3: Ac)."
ALL_PANELS,Culvert remediation in watersheds with relatively high integrity also impacted the IWI scores downstream from the culvert (compare the Petersville Road in Figure 3: Bc and Bw).
ALL_PANELS,"For developed areas with high concentrations of culverts and other stressors, we found that the impact of remediation on the catchment ICI scores (Figure 3: Cc) was negligible compared with the change to the IWI scores downstream (Figure 3: Cw)."

ALL_PANELS,A majority of the watersheds with IWI values below 0.90 were in the Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,"By having a standard cell that would be implemented in laboratories throughout the world, measurements made in different laboratories and modeling could be compared on a side-by-side basis (see example in figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The GECRC is still actively used more than 30 years later, having served as a valuable asset to the research community [4, 5] and continues to be a benchmark for validating codes (see figure 1 as a recent example)."
ALL_PANELS,"Measured absolute atomic oxygen densities for varying humidity admixtures obtained using ns-TALIF [36], synchrotron VUV absorption [10] and ps-TALIF [37] are shown in figure 3."
ALL_PANELS,"Subsequently, two rounds of exercises were attempted, in some cases revealing unanticipated disagreements in the computational calculations presented by the participants (see figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Recommendations for code development
In the following we provide some practical recommendations (see figure 7) for developing research software that is open and adheres to FAIR principles [141, 142]."
ALL_PANELS,"Here we classify data into two general types, experimental and computational, and in three general forms, raw, processed (or analyzed) and a third category we term extracted data, as shown in figure 8."
ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, raw charge-voltage data used to produce a Lissajous plot may be smoothed by a filter, as illustrated in figure 9."
ALL_PANELS,"There has been a noticeable trend in the graphical presentation of data to move away from simpler x–y scatter plots, which show single points with error bars (or confidence internals) that are often not well-defined and ambiguously open to interpretation, to scatter plots that include the raw data with the statistical information overlaid [174]. (See, for example, figure 10.) In the physical sciences, concerns often arise based on how extracted quantities are determined and presented, where inconsistencies within a field make it difficult to both assess the validity of the claims in the paper and to compare to prior literature."
ALL_PANELS,"For this application, treatment is characterized by the J cm−2 delivered to the surface [203, 204] although the range of operating conditions for which this dose-driven description applies is limited. (See figure 11.) Characterizing treatment of polymers by J cm−2 is typically done for atmospheric pressure plasma treatment in a specified ambient—for example, air or He."

Open in a new tabElement-wise DATA scores, which range from 0 to 2, were mostly clustered at either 0 or 2 (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The exceptions were two projects that scored a 1 for Discoverable, and two other projects that had an element score of 1 for either Transparent or Actionable (Table 2; Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"DATA scores for the 104 articles that we scored ranged from 0 (the minimum score) to 8 (the maximum score), though the distribution of scores was heavily skewed towards low values with 55 journal articles scoring zero (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tabElement-wise DATA scores were primarily clustered around zero, as expected given the overall DATA score distribution, with slightly more than half of Discoverable and Accessible scores and about 60% of Transparent and Actionable scores ranking zero (Fig 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Unlike the broad distribution that we observed in the DATA scores associated with journal articles (Fig 3), which indicates variable levels of data sharing effectiveness, we found that project-level datasets were either not shared (DATA = 0; 76% of projects) or were shared fairly effectively (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Element-wise DATA scores were primarily clustered around zero, as expected given the overall DATA score distribution, with slightly more than half of Discoverable and Accessible scores and about 60% of Transparent and Actionable scores ranking zero (Fig 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"The BCG model divides the condition gradient into 6 levels of biological condition, from (1) undisturbed to (6) highly disturbed (Fig. 1; Davies and Jackson, 2006; USEPA, 2016b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig. 1 shows the conceptual BCG model which describes incremental biological changes along a gradient of anthropogenic stressors, in which the IWI and ICI represent a generalized landscape integrity gradient."
ALL_PANELS,"In a 2D scatterplot, we can relate the IWI and ICI with estimates of biological condition, represented by synthetic data, to illustrate how site-scale biological condition data could be combined with multiscale landscape integrity data to inform management decisions on appropriate actions to protect or restore stream habitat (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Watershed- and catchment-scale indicators can either be plotted on a scale of integrity (as shown here), or on a scale of stressors which would be plotted as 1 minus the index value (e.g., 1 – IWI value) so that high stressors are at the origin, and low stressors are associated with the upper right quadrant.The four quadrants in Fig. 2 were obtained by drawing two perpendicular lines positioned at the 0.5 value of each integrity index."
ALL_PANELS,"As a further example of the utility of this framework, we provide examples of how multiscale landscape integrity data, when visualized in a map, could provide managers with a powerful tool for identifying sites that meet certain protection and restoration criteria (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Such a map could allow managers to easily identify priority areas for protection, i.e., those with high IWI and high ICI values (represented by blue catchments), and areas for restoration, i.e., high IWI and low ICI values (green catchments, Fig. 3)."

ALL_PANELS,"The 3D scatterplot in Fig. 4 relates the biological condition of streams to three landscape integrity gradients: watershed, catchment and stream-reach scale."
ALL_PANELS,"Similar to the map in Fig. 3, a landscape integrity map displaying catchments according to the level (high or low) of watershed, catchment, and stream-reach scale integrity could be highly valuable for prioritizing areas for protection and restoration."

ALL_PANELS,"The rate of •OH reaction with solid surfaces (t = 0 h) dominated the fate of •OH by several orders of magnitude, relative to TCE and H2O2 in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Conversely, in our study, •OH reaction was dominated by surface scavenging at 10–50 g/L silica, alumina, or MMT, in both Fe-AHP and UV-AHP systems (Fig. 1), and even greater •OH scavenging was projected under unconsolidated porous media conditions (Fig. 2)."

ALL_PANELS,"However, in the survey data currently available, students expressed a preference for the blended approach over the largely synchronous approach (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Examining accompanying student survey comments, the accepted benefits of flexibility, convenience, and ability to personalize learning were frequently noted.2,12 For example, “I can choose my own time to study;” “the time is flexible;” “narrated videos give me more freedom…if I miss some points, I can pause and watch that part of the video again;” “I can repeat the points which I didn’t get and skip the parts I know.”

ALL_PANELS,"The Leader Intron Increased GmScreamM8 (Soybean eEF1A) Promoter Activity
To evaluate the effect of the GmScreamM8 leader intron on the high activity of the GmScreamM8 promoter, intron deletion and translocation constructs were generated and validated using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons and stable expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1)."
1b,"The intron-containing GmScreamM8 promoter construct gave much higher transient GFP expression, compared to the intron-less GmSM8ni promoter construct (Fig 1b)."
1b,"Translocation of the intron sequence upstream of the pre-intronic sequence of the GmScreamM8 promoter in both sense (GmSM8InfP) and antisense (GmSM8InrP) orientations yielded lower levels of transient expression compared with the GmScreamM8 promoter, with somewhat higher expression from the upstream placement of the intron in the sense orientation (Fig 1b)."
1c,Stably-transformed soybean hairy root events from the intron-less (GmSM8ni) and intron translocation constructs (GmSM8InfP; GmSM8InrP) all showed similar expression levels that were not significantly different from each other (Fig 1c).
1c,"The GmScreamM8 promoter, with the full intron in its native position, gave the highest expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1c)."
1c,"The expression patterns were the same for all hairy roots, as all roots displayed higher expression in the root elongation zone and root tips (Fig 1c)."
ALL_PANELS,"To further dissect the intronic sequences that enhanced gene expression, the full-length native promoter was evaluated with four intron internal deletions (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Three of the four intron internal deletion constructs (Fig 2a), GmSM8InD2, GmSM8InD3, and GmSM8InD4, gave rise to a level of transient GFP expression lower than the full intron-containing GmScreamM8 promoter but higher than the intron-less construct GmSM8ni (Fig 2b)."
2c,"In stably transformed soybean hairy roots, the three deletion constructs drove levels of GFP expression significantly lower than the GmScreamM8 promoter but higher than GmSM8ni (Fig 2c)."
ALL_PANELS,"Another large intron deletion construct, GmSM8InD1, in which the majority of the intron sequence (parts 2, 3, and 4) was removed, displayed very weak but detectable activity in both transient and stable expression analyses (Fig 2)."
"d, l","Reverse transcription PCR revealed that intron splicing took place with all the constructs except GmSM8InD1, where the intron was not processed, leading to a larger amplicon (Fig 2d, left)."
ALL_PANELS,"This was further confirmed by sequencing.The Leader Intron Enhanced the Activity of Proximal Promoter Elements
To simplify the identification of the intronic sequence that contributed to high gene expression, a synthetic promoter consisting of an element tetramer and a core promoter was developed (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Different combinations of the EF4 tetramer from GmScreamM1 with the 35S core or GmScreamM8 core promoter, with and without the GmScreamM8 intron, showed that the tetramer with the GmScreamM8 core and GmScreamM8 intron gave the highest activity (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,This high activity was observed using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons (Fig 3b) and stable expression in transgenic soybean hairy roots (Fig 3c).
3b,Another intron-containing construct (4xEF4-35Score-M8Intron) with the 35S core promoter rather than the GmScreamM8 core promoter also displayed significantly enhanced gene expression in comparison with its intron-less counterpart (4xEF4-35Score) (Fig 3b).
3b,"However, use of the leader intron did not show any enhancement of gene expression when it was cloned downstream of the 35S core promoter without the EF4 tetramer (Fig 3b)."
3c,"In transformed soybean hairy roots, the 4xEF4-M8C construct showed the highest expression among all the element-intron variants (Fig 3c), similar to what was seen using transient expression analysis."
3c,Intron-containing constructs (4xEF4-35Score-M8Intron; 4xEF4-M8C) drove significantly higher GFP expression than the counterparts without the intron (4xEF4-35Score; 4xEF4-M8Core) and the constructs containing only a core promoter and the intron but without the regulatory element tetramer (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C) (Fig 3c).
3c,"For core promoters (35Score or GmSM8Core), the intensity of GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots was significantly increased by 2–4 fold if the EF4 tetramer was present upstream (Fig 3c)."
ALL_PANELS,"However, use of either core promoter (35Score or GmSM8Core) without the EF4 tetramer, and either with or without the intron (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C), resulted in low but still detectable expression levels (Fig 3c).Deletion of a 222 bp Intron Internal Sequence Led to Reduced Activity
Using transient expression analysis of constructs containing the EF4 tetramer, the GmScreamM8 core, and three different intron deletions, reduced expression was obtained only when part 3 of the intron (4xEF4-M8CInD3; Fig 4a) was deleted, while deletion of part 2 (4xEF4-M8CInD2) or part 4 (4xEF4-M8CInD4) did not significantly influence the intensity of gene expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8C, which possessed a full intron (Fig 4b)."
4c,"For the other deletion constructs, 4xEF4-M8CInD2 displayed a significant lower activity than the control 4xEF4-M8C, while 4xEF4-M8CInD4 did not show a significant difference (Fig 4c)."
ALL_PANELS,"Analysis of three additional intron variants (Fig 5a), where intron parts 2, 3, and 4 were individually evaluated, revealed that the 4xEF4-M8CIN3 gave two-fold higher GFP transient expression than the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (same to 4xEF4-M8C with addition of two restriction sites; see Materials and Methods), which possessed the intact intron (Fig 5b)."
5c,"In stably-transformed hairy roots, 4xEF4-M8CIN3 showed comparable activity to 4xEF4-M8CIN234, and significantly higher expression than 4xEF4-M8CIN2 and 4xEF4-M8CIN4 (Fig 5c)."
ALL_PANELS,Further analysis of intron variants (Fig 6a) revealed that the monomeric and the trimeric repeat of the 222 bp intronic sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3; 4xEF4-M8CIN333) gave approximately two-fold higher expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 using transient expression analysis (Fig 6b).
6b,"Another intron variant 4xEF4-M8CIN234234, showed 1.5X higher expression than 4xEF4-M8CIN234, but still lower than 4xEF4-M8CIN3 (Fig 6b)."
6c,"For stable expression in soybean hairy roots, the stuffed intron (4xEF4-M8CIN23334) showed the highest expression compared to other intron variants, and a significant difference was observed between the stuffed intron and the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (Fig 6c)."
7a,"Overlapping columns show no significant differences between constructs by the t test (LSD) at p<0.05.DNA sequencing revealed that the 222 bp intronic sequence mainly contained an array of two and a half short imperfect repeats, in lengths of 60 bp, 60 bp, and 30 bp (Fig 7a and 7b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Deletion of the whole repeated sequence within the intron (4xEF4-M8CIN3D1) led to 50% decrease of GFP expression in transient expression as well as a significant decrease in GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots, while retention of the first 60 bp repeat sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3D2) did not restore the activity of the whole repeated sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3), as evaluated using both transient and stable expression (Fig 7c and 7d).Discussion
Transient Expression
Use of the automated image collection and analysis system with GFP allowed for continual monitoring of promoter activity over 100 h (Figs 1–7), generating consistent results for measurement of promoter strength."
ALL_PANELS,"This approach has been useful for quantification of the effects of promoters [39], intron-variants [26] and cis-regulatory elements [38], and seems to be useful for evaluation of the promoter and intron variants described in this research.Stable Expression in Hairy Roots
Promoter-mediated gene expression levels in stably transformed soybean hairy roots were largely reflective of the levels obtained using transient expression analysis (Figs 1–5 and 7), with slight inconsistency across systems in certain instances (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although use of hairy roots for promoter analysis does have some limitations, evaluation of gene expression in stably transformed soybean hairy roots can be a good general indicator of promoter strength in whole transgenic plants [26, 34, 38].Intron-Mediated Enhancement
Removal of the leader intron from the original GmScreamM8 promoter (GmSM8ni, Fig 1) resulted in 60% decrease in gene expression, suggesting that the leader intron significantly contributed to the high activity of the ~1.5 kb promoter (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Introduction of intron translocation constructs (GmSM8InfP and GmSM8InrP) (Fig 1) did not lead to high GFP expression, suggesting that the GmScreamM8 leader intron did not contain classical enhancers that could increase gene expression independent of the position and orientation."
ALL_PANELS,"Partial deletion of intronic regions (part 2, part 3, part 4) in GmScreamM8 did not completely abolish intron enhancement of gene expression (Fig 2), but resulted in different levels of reduction in expression, indicating a redundancy of IME signals, which is common with this type of intron [55], possibly due to the interactions of intronic regulatory sequences throughout the GmScreamM8 intron and the multiple proximal promoter regulatory motifs."
ALL_PANELS,Analysis of intron partial deletion constructs with the full-length promoter showed that the partial deletions reduced promoter activity (Fig 2).
ALL_PANELS,"The largest intron deletion construct GmSM8InD1 (Fig 2), with only a 68 bp intron sequence remaining, showed very low but detectable GFP expression in both transient and stable expression assays."
ALL_PANELS,"Although the 35S core has been widely used for evaluation of cis-regulatory elements due to its low background expression and efficient transcriptional initiation [61], the GmScreamM8 core was more efficient than the 35S core for intron sequence evaluation, as the leader intron exhibited a larger gene enhancement with the GmScreamM8 core compared to the 35S core using our transient and stable expression assays, with or without the element tetramer upstream of core promoters (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"With synthetic introns, intron sequences of interest can be evaluated by manipulating the copy number and sequences of intron regions (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"These types of intron variants, in addition to the intron translocation constructs (Fig 1) and the partial internal deletion constructs (Figs 4, 5 and 7), can be very useful for identifying intron components that contribute to increased gene expression."
ALL_PANELS,"Further truncation of the repeated sequence within the intron led to dramatic reductions in GFP expression (Fig 7), indicating that the whole repeated sequence contributed to high levels of gene expression."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, a TAGATC was found in the three imperfect repeated sequences of our GmScreamM8 leader intron (Fig 7)."
"a, s","For a series of intron deletion variants, to make sure the intron was efficiently spliced, the 5’ splice site, 3’ splice site, and the branch site were retained in all intron variant constructs, while the rest of intronic sequence named “part 1” (= 702 bp) was further divided into three regions with a similar size, named “part 2” (= 269 bp), “part 3” (= 222 bp), and “part 4” (= 211 bp) (Fig 2a and S1 File)."
7c,"Deletion of the whole repeated sequence within the intron (4xEF4-M8CIN3D1) led to 50% decrease of GFP expression in transient expression as well as a significant decrease in GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots, while retention of the first 60 bp repeat sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3D2) did not restore the activity of the whole repeated sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3), as evaluated using both transient and stable expression (Fig 7c and 7d)."
ALL_PANELS,"To evaluate the effect of the GmScreamM8 leader intron on the high activity of the GmScreamM8 promoter, intron deletion and translocation constructs were generated and validated using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons and stable expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The Leader Intron Enhanced the Activity of Proximal Promoter Elements
To simplify the identification of the intronic sequence that contributed to high gene expression, a synthetic promoter consisting of an element tetramer and a core promoter was developed (Fig 3)."
3c,"However, use of either core promoter (35Score or GmSM8Core) without the EF4 tetramer, and either with or without the intron (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C), resulted in low but still detectable expression levels (Fig 3c)."
ALL_PANELS,"To simplify the identification of the intronic sequence that contributed to high gene expression, a synthetic promoter consisting of an element tetramer and a core promoter was developed (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Deletion of a 222 bp Intron Internal Sequence Led to Reduced Activity
Using transient expression analysis of constructs containing the EF4 tetramer, the GmScreamM8 core, and three different intron deletions, reduced expression was obtained only when part 3 of the intron (4xEF4-M8CInD3; Fig 4a) was deleted, while deletion of part 2 (4xEF4-M8CInD2) or part 4 (4xEF4-M8CInD4) did not significantly influence the intensity of gene expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8C, which possessed a full intron (Fig 4b)."

ALL_PANELS,"On the other hand, the loss of the RFI from solvent relaxation quenching may be attributed to the less hydrophobic contacts, hence, a lower energy level of excited Trp (Rizzo et al. 1986).SDS–PAGE
The covalent attachment of SP–PD was verified by SDS–PAGE with protein as well as carbohydrate staining in Fig. 4."
4a,"The electrophoretic patterns of SP–PD conjugates with peptide-staining Coomassie blue reagent (Fig. 4a) showed a faint, continuing smear that ran through the entire upper region (>30 kDa) of the lane in the SP–PD1 and SP–PD2 samples, differing sharply from the SP control (without dextran) that consisted of only the fragments of soy proteins (<30 kDa)."

3b,"Non-adaptive response to stress (Fig. 3b)
i.As relevant to police contexts, ANS over or under activation results in a variety of detriments, including cognitive, sensory and perceptual narrowing that may hinder performance during field duties (e.g., poor motor control, reduced situational awareness, learning and memory) (Anderson et al., 2019; Baldwin et al., 2022; Di Nota & Huhta, 2019)."
3c,"Describe that there are no exact HR values that directly lead to adaptive versus non-adaptive performance, but rather, research has demonstrated general zones of effectiveness (Fig. 3c)."
ALL_PANELS,"The first technique instructed in our protocol is the ‘Reset Breath.’ Similar to a physiological sigh (Vlemincx et al., 2013), the Reset Breath stimulates the vagus nerve and signals the brain (see Fig. 1) to provide a short window during which the officer can shift attention from the unease that accompanies the stress response and refocus on the task at hand (Arpaia & Andersen, 2019; Bennell et al., 2021; Laborde et al., 2018; Vlemincx et al., 2013; Zelano et al., 2016)."
ALL_PANELS,"To demonstrate the Reset Breath in action, show the sample HRVB screen trace (Fig. 4) and describe the following:
“The graphic shown here depicts the real time HR response of a physician responding to a call to visit a patient’s room."
ALL_PANELS,"This will allow you to Refocus your attention on what’s important now, broaden your situational awareness, and enable more effective Responding through better decision-making and motor control.”
As a major practical component of RRR training we have officers partner up and practice the Reset Breath while assuming a grounded position, often called the interview stance in policing (Fig. 5) for approximately 3 min (at least two Reset Breaths per partner)."
ALL_PANELS,"A grounded state is in line with the interview stance, a body position that enhances safety and readiness for optimal physical action (see Fig. 5)."
3c,"Specifically, instructors can intervene if they observe that officers are at risk of becoming physiologically overactivated (Fig. 3c) or confirm that officers are applying the RRR technique effectively based on the HRVB trace."
ALL_PANELS,"Return to the home screen and confirm that your real-time HR is visible moving across the screen, displayed as purple dots (see Fig. 4 for screen view)."
ALL_PANELS,"Before the first scenario begins, the instructor or an additional facilitator will begin recording the officer using the video function on the HRV Trace app, which superimposes the real-time HRVB trace (Fig. 6)."
7c,"The instructor will then issue an ‘end scenario’ command.
i.At the start and stop commands, the facilitator will pull an event marker in the HRV Trace app to manually mark the HRVB data (Fig. 7c)."
ALL_PANELS,"Increases in HR are observed as they correspond to events in the scenario as is seen in Fig. 4 (e.g., suspect behaviours, officer commands or actions)."
ALL_PANELS,"To demonstrate this, we show officers Fig. 7 to contrast resting HR (panel a) from HR during Recovery Breathing (panel b), during which vagal tone is promoted and physiological recovery occurs.

“Every person has a breathing rate which will maximize their optimal level of activation to maintain effectiveness, and this can be seen in the HRVB trace."
8a,"In a group setting, seven different paces (7.2, 6.8, 6.4, 6.0, 5.6, 5.2) are practiced for two minutes each using the ‘training’ setting in the HRV Trace app (Fig. 8a)."

"a, t","In one set of experiments, dFISH was performed using dual riboprobes to detect both the plus and the minus strands of SmedTV, designed to nonoverlapping regions of the viral genome (Fig. 3A, top row)."
3a,"Within confocal sections through the worm (region of head shown in Fig. 3A), SmedTV RNA was detected in only a subset of discrete cells, and both strands consistently colocalized within these cells (101/101 SmedTV-staining cells that we counted)."
"a, m","Interestingly, colocalization of the two strands of SmedTV RNA was most readily evident in cell nuclei, also colocalizing with the nuclear counterstain (Fig. 3A, middle row)."
ALL_PANELS,"Consistent with this finding, few SmedTV-staining cells were detected by dFISH among piwi-1-expressing stem cells (30) in confocal sections through stem cell-rich regions of worm trunks (Fig. 3C, green and magenta, respectively); moreover, the few SmedTV-staining cells that were seen in these regions appear not to express piwi-1 (Fig. 3C)."
3d,"Two single-cell RNA-seq data sets previously reported from different labs (BioProjects PRJNA276084 and PRJNA317292) (31, 32) supported the observation that fewer sequence reads from SmedTV were found in X1 stem cells and other neoblasts than in differentiated tissues, particularly neural cell types (Fig. 3D)."
3e,"By reexamining these data, we found that 22 of 25 cells with the highest levels of sequence reads from SmedTV (average log fold change [avg_logFC] values > 3.5) mapped to previously defined cell type clusters representing the neural class (33) (Fig. 3E)."
3e,"Expanding to examine the top 100 cells for SmedTV (avg_logFC values > 2.5), we found that 56 cells mapped to the neural class, with the other 44 cells distributed among seven other tissue classes: cathepsin+ (12 cells), protonephridia (8 cells), epidermis (6 cells), muscle (5 cells), parenchyma (5 cells), intestine (4 cells), and neoblasts (4 cells) (Fig. 3E)."
3f,This was indicated by differences in marker gene expression (log2 [number of reads/transcript]) as illustrated using a heat map (Fig. 3F).
"a, r","To address this question, we performed WISH to identify SmedTV-staining cells in GFP(RNAi) (i.e., control) worms versus worms that underwent triple knockdown of piwi-1, -2, and -3 (30, 35) by RNAi (efficiency of knockdowns described here and below confirmed by quantitative PCR [qPCR] [Fig. 4A, right])."
"a, t","We observed no discernible changes in the apparent numbers or distributions of SmedTV-staining cells in any of these piwi-1,2,3(RNAi) worms by WISH or when quantified by qPCR (Fig. 4A, top)."
"a, b","Reciprocally, similar results were obtained upon ablation of stem cells by ionizing irradiation (Fig. 4A, bottom right)."
4b,"Again, however, we observed no discernible changes in the apparent numbers or distributions of SmedTV-staining cells in the RIG-I(RNAi) worms versus control(RNAi) worms examined by WISH or when quantified by qPCR (Fig. 4B)."
4c,"To address this possibility, we combined FISH and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (40) to determine whether cells undergoing apoptosis might correspond to those that stain for SmedTV (Fig. 4C)."
5a,"Heads and tails were amputated from worms, and the remaining trunk fragments were fixed at various time points (1, 3, 7, 9, and 14 days) postamputation (pa) (Fig. 5A)."
"a, s","Interestingly, WISH demonstrated very few, if any, cells staining for SmedTV in either the head or the tail blastemas (newly regenerated tissue) until 7 dpa (Fig. 5A, second from right)."
"a, f","By 9 dpa, strongly SmedTV-staining cells were more generally found in the regenerated head tissue, with further increases evident by 14 dpa, including in the eyespots (Fig. 5A, far right)."
2a,"The tricladiviruses show more distant, yet evident, phylogenetic relationships to Totiviridae family member GLV and other toti-like viruses, such as LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, that have been tentatively assigned to family Totiviridae (see Fig. 2A), and we therefore find it sensible at this point to identify the tricladiviruses also as tentative members of family Totiviridae.Proteins."
ALL_PANELS,"The tricladiviruses, like some other toti-like viruses, instead have three long ORFs in their genomic plus strands, but including two ORFs that overlap and have the same coding capacities for an apparent CP (P1) and RdRp (P2) as just described (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Among the related viruses shown in Fig. 2A, nonenveloped virus particles with isometric capsids have also been shown for Camponotus yamaokai virus (CyV), GLV, and LbTV (20, 22, 23, 42), and none of the other viruses in Fig. 2A have been suggested to lack such capsids."
2a,"As only CP and RdRp are essential for totivirus replication (most viruses in Fig. 2A have ORFs for only these two proteins), some auxiliary role for P0 seems possible or even likely."
ALL_PANELS,These cells appear to be concentrated in neural structures but are scattered through other worm tissues as well (Fig. 3).
ALL_PANELS,"In this light, we propose that SmedTV is transmitted to progeny worms by most or all cells in each manually divided fragment of the mother, including stem cells and others in which SmedTV replication/expression has been repressed to lower levels (Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"As tissue regeneration proceeds in the progeny worms, SmedTV replication/expression is then derepressed along certain differentiating cell lineages, including some photoreceptors and other neurons (Fig. 6) but cells in other tissues as well (Fig. 3)."
2a,"Related viruses in Fig. 2A for which evidence of vertical transmission during sexual reproduction has been obtained are CyV and LbTV (20, 42).Nuclear localization."
2a,Evidence in this report for the presence of both strands of SmedTV RNA in the nuclei of planarian cells is thus consistent with these findings for GLV and also consistent with the fact that GLV and the tricladiviruses share a relatively close phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 2A).
2a,"The tricladiviruses show more distant, yet evident, phylogenetic relationships to Totiviridae family member GLV and other toti-like viruses, such as LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, that have been tentatively assigned to family Totiviridae (see Fig. 2A), and we therefore find it sensible at this point to identify the tricladiviruses also as tentative members of family Totiviridae."
2a,"Related viruses in Fig. 2A for which evidence of vertical transmission during sexual reproduction has been obtained are CyV and LbTV (20, 42)."

ALL_PANELS,Riboprobes for SmedTV were prepared from two pPR-T4P plasmids into which a region of sequence from either end of the SmedTV genome had been cloned (nt positions 510 to 2094 [region 1] or nt positions 6318 to 7874 [region 2]; position numbers based on the SmedTV plus-strand consensus sequence represented in Fig. 1).
"a, t","For the colocalization analysis of SmedTV RNA in Fig. 3A, the respective riboprobes were designed to hybridize either to a 3′-proximal region of the genomic plus strand (minus-strand probe transcribed from cloned region 2) or to a 3′-proximal region of the genomic minus strand (plus-strand probe transcribed from cloned region 1)."

ALL_PANELS,"Eighteen different medications showed statistically significant associations with refractive error after adjustment for multiple testing (Table, Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The associations between IOP-lowering medication and SpE were driven by participants who reported spectacle correction earlier in life (AOSW< 35 years) (Table), particularly in the first two decades (Fig. 2), well before the age in which these medications are typically prescribed."
ALL_PANELS,"These associations were particularly significant among individuals who started refractive correction after the fourth decade of life (Fig. 3), but because we lacked suitable instrumental variables (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] significantly associated with their intake in addition to the diseases they are indicated for) we were unable to draw firm conclusions about the direction of causality."

ALL_PANELS,"Vaccine Platforms
Multiple vaccine platforms have been explored for COVID-19 vaccine
development as each vaccine platform has unique advantages and disadvantages
(Table 1 and Figure 4).22 It is very likely that the world will need more than one
type of approved vaccine to combat this pandemic with assurance of
broad target population coverage, production quantities, and storage
and transportation requirements on top of vaccine safety and effectiveness."
ALL_PANELS,"Because it is inherently safe and uses well-established
techniques of protein purification, these vaccines comprise the largest
category in COVID-19 vaccine development, as shown in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"A total of 24 COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine candidates have entered
clinical trials, including those by Novavax, Anhui Zhifei Longcom
Biopharmaceutical, Kentucky Bioprocessing, and Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK) (Table 3), while
68 more are in preclinical evaluation (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Like mammalian
mRNA, mRNA vaccines produced by in vitro transcription
(IVT) contain an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5′ and
3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), a 5′-cap, and a 3′
polyadenylation (poly(A)) tail, as shown in Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition,
without a cap, the IVT mRNA would be recognized as foreign RNA by
the host immune system through a mechanism mediated by Toll-like receptors
7/8.79 Capping of IVT mRNA would prevent
its recognition by the host immune system and reduce immunogenicity
caused by mRNA molecule itself.77,80
The elongated
poly (A) tail at the 3′ end is important for the stability
and subsequent translation of mRNA.81 Incorporation
of UTR sequences enhances mRNA half-life and translation efficiency.82 For example, incorporating a human β-globin
UTR to both 5′- and 3′-UTR of the mRNA has been shown
to enhance the stability and translational efficiency,83 whereas insertion of an α-globin UTR to
the 3′-UTR region increased the mRNA stability.84 Both 3′- and 5′-UTR regions can
also inhibit decapping and degradation of mRNA.83,84 As such, sequence modifications in both 5′- and 3′-UTRs
have been explored to enhance the mRNA vaccine functionality.85
In addition, unmodified IVT mRNA sequences
can stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate the innate immune
system.86 To reduce immunogenicity of the
IVT mRNA, a variety of modified nucleotides have been introduced into
the ORF region.86,87 For instance, designed incorporation
of pseudouridine (ψ) (Figure 6) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve
translation.88 Additionally, mRNA containing
N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1ψ) (Figure 6) exhibited an increase
in translational efficiency.89 Recent studies
have shown that this increase is related to N1-methyl-pseudouridine
induced enhancement of ribosome recycling to the same mRNA.90

The ‘Omics of Lethal Human Viruses (OMICS-LHV) Systems Biology Center was funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) from June 2013 to June 2018 (grant # U19AI106772), and was tasked with using a systems biology approach (Fig. 1) to study host responses to four viral pathogens that cause lethal disease in humans: Influenza A virus (IAV, Orthomyxoviridae family), Ebola virus (EBOV, Filoviridae family), West Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae family), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, Coronaviridae family) (an overview of basic virology and virus-associated diseases are provided in Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"From this, models of host responses may be used to develop hypotheses, which may be tested by perturbing the system and repeating the systems biology data analysis lifecycle.Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"The overall goal was to collect samples from various in vitro and in vivo infection models and perform multi-omics analyses comprising global transcriptomics (mRNA and microRNA), proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics; however, in some experiments only transcriptomics analyses were performed (Fig. 3)."

"a, b","Considering a variable attachment efficiency with size classes, the use of the ANN-based correlations in the present study, underpredicts the BTC plateau in both cases more noticeably (R2 < 0) than the previous study (Fig. 2a,b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Investigating mean hydrodynamic diameter growth over time as shown in Fig. 5, reveals that when aggregation is included, the change in size is not considerable at wells #1 and #2 while it becomes significant at wells #3 to #6, where size trends exhibit a peak corresponding to the centre of the BTC but, with a more gradual rise and fall compared to the BTC."
ALL_PANELS,"Taken into account these time limits there will be two parallel studies (flowchart, Fig. 1):


Study 1 (RCT 1) with a time frame 0–4 weeks post-rupture: patients are randomized 1:1 to DIS or IBLA

Study selection

16a
Describe the results of the search and selection process, from the number of records identified in the search to the number of studies included in the review, ideally using a flow diagram (see fig 1)."
1a,We find that the number of newly highlighted genes increased most strongly between the mid-1990s and early 2000s (Fig 1A).
1a,"By 2018, 86% of all genes had been highlighted at least once, and 76% of all genes had been mentioned by one of their names in the title of at least 1 publication (Fig 1A)."
1b,"Third, starting in the late 1990s, only a vanishing fraction of gene–publication pairs published in a given year address newly (highlighted in the same year) or recently (highlighted within the past 5 years) highlighted genes (Fig 1B)."
1c,"Fourth, starting in the late 1990s, newly and recently highlighted genes became underrepresented relative to their absolute number (Fig 1C), even when accounting for the physiological importance of genes through their loss-of-function intolerance in human populations [32] (S4A Fig) or the occurrence of phenotypes in systematic murine mutagenesis experiments [33] (S4B and S4C Fig) or genome-wide association studies [34] (S4D Fig)."
1a,"Second, there already appears to be a saturation of the annual number of newly highlighted genes (Fig 1A)."
"a, sa","We find that until the early 2000s, the average and median number of authors on early-stage publications closely matches the average and median number of authors of publications highlighting only older genes (Fig 2A, S5A Fig)."
"a, sa","From 2010 onward, we observe that early-stage research into genes is produced by much larger teams than observed for teams authoring publications highlighting only older genes (Fig 2A, S5A Fig)."
"a, sa","This increase also exceeds the increase anticipated from extrapolating from preceding increases in mean and median team sizes (Fig 2A, S5A Fig)."
2b,"Supporting this view, we find that since the 1970s, the average number of genes highlighted in publications that newly highlight a gene is nearly the double of the average number of genes highlighted in publications that only highlight older genes (Fig 2B)."
2c,"Confirming our hypothesis, we find that since the mid-2000s, the probability of an early-stage research publication becoming highly cited was double that of publications highlighting only older genes (Fig 2C)."
2d,"Intriguingly, we observe that 1980s publications reporting early-stage research publications were more likely to be cited by clinical trials than publications on old gene targets (Fig 2D)."
"a, s","For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.Nonetheless, we find that some journals enrich for research publications on novel gene targets to an extent that is higher than anticipated by chance (red dots) (Fig 3A, S7 Fig)."
"b, s","Next, we focus on research publications on gene targets that were first highlighted in the 5 preceding years (Fig 3B, S7 Fig)."
"b, s","In contrast to the analysis for the enrichment for novel gene targets, when considering early-stage research, we find that few journals deplete for publications on early-stage research on gene targets to an extent that is higher than anticipated by chance (cyan dots) (Fig 3B, S7 Fig)."
3c,"Comparing the extent to which journals enrich for newly highlighted versus recently highlighted genes, we find that journals dedicated to neurobiology and obesity are enriching for recently highlighted genes to a larger extent than their enrichment for newly highlighted genes (Fig 3C)."
ALL_PANELS,"We consider funding agencies, distinct funding mechanisms, and NIH-supported research organizations (Fig 4, S8–S11 Figs)."
4a,"For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.The contexts implicated through funding agencies resemble those presented among journals—with the support for early-stage research between 2010 and 2018 preferentially stemming from genome biology (NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute [NHGRI]—one of several different agencies within the NIH), generalist funding agencies (NIH’s National Institute of General Medical Sciences [NIGMS], European Research Council, etc.), or funders of age-related neuropathies (Motor Neurone Disease Association and NIH’s National Institutes on Aging [NIA]) (Fig 4A–4C, S8 Fig)."
4a,"In line with a prior study that reported that Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators may be more willing to change their research focus [27], we also find that publications supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute are enriched for early-stage research (Fig 4A–4C, S8 Fig)."
4b,"This change contrasts with the funding patterns of Cancer Research UK, which has consistently supported researchers producing publications enriched for early-stage research (Fig 4B–4D, S8 Fig)."
4b,"Concluding our analysis of the research contexts under which early-stage research occurs, we investigate research organizations that are recipients of NIH grants (Fig 4B–4D, S11 Fig)."
ALL_PANELS,"For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.Previously, we observed that early-stage research into genes engages more authors, highlights more genes, and is more likely to receive a higher number of citations (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,We recognize that the previously noted increase in team size for early-stage research (Fig 2A) stems from genome biology (Fig 5C).
ALL_PANELS,"By contrast, the previously noted increase in the number of highlighted genes (Fig 2B) also persists outside of genome biology (Fig 5D) but is twice as large for genome biology, while publications on old gene targets highlight the same number of genes irrespectively of whether they fall within genome biology or not (Fig 5D)."
ALL_PANELS,The previously noted increased probability for early-stage research to become highly cited (Fig 2C) appears independent of genome biology (Fig 5E).
ALL_PANELS,"In line with the overall theme of our work, this further indicates the necessity and possibility to identify the specific contexts behind early-stage research as some beliefs about innovation might not generalize.Domain-specific research into a handful of genes contributes to early-stage research
While approaches used within genome biology are well positioned to identify novel gene targets [29] (Fig 5A), we previously observed that early-stage research on recent gene targets differs from early-stage research on novel gene targets by further extending to journals dedicated to neurobiology and obesity (Fig 3)."
1a,"We again focus here on the period of 2010 to 2018 for timeliness, but similar analyses for other periods are included in S17 Fig. During this time period, we find that 3,943 newly highlighted genes could have been investigated as recent gene targets (Fig 1A)."
3c,Journals are considered to disproportionally enrich for recent gene targets if they enrich for recent gene targets at least twice as much as they enrich for novel gene targets (above dashed line in Fig 3C). (D) Different top 40 genes are highlighted in publications from journals dedicated to different fields.
3c,Shown are journals that highlight recent gene targets and enrich for recent gene targets at least twice as much as they enrich for novel gene targets (above dashed line in Fig 3C).
1b,"For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.This small subset of top ranked recently highlighted genes defies the general trend of biomedical research rarely turning to new gene targets (Fig 1B and 1C, S3 Fig) [14]."
3c,"Finally, we return to our observation of neurological and obesity-related journals enriching for early-stage gene targets to an extent that exceeds their enrichment on novel gene targets (10 journals above dashed line, Fig 3C)."

ALL_PANELS,"Using transient and stable expression assays, the 4xEF4mut1.5‐M8C construct, where the 2‐bp proximal flanking nucleotides of the non‐functional recreated G‐box were changed to the exact flanking sequences of the functional native G‐box, yielded up to eleven times higher GFP expression in lima bean cotyledonary tissues (Figure 3b) and over twelve times higher GFP expression in stably transformed soybean hairy roots (Figure 3c), compared to the 4xEF4mut1.3‐M8C construct that contained the same recreated G‐box element with its native flanking sequences."

ALL_PANELS,Figure 2 illustrates the mean escape latency in seconds for each untreated group (t0) with the error bars denoting the corresponding positive standard deviation.
ALL_PANELS,The colored * above each bar in Fig. 2 represents a significant pairwise comparison between the group corresponding to the labeled bar and the group corresponding to the color of the asterisk.
ALL_PANELS,"In the present study’s aggregate data analysis, statistical comparison of mean normalized MWM escape latency data in untreated transgenic APOE AD mice indicated that untreated knock-in APOE3 (KI3_t0, Fig. 2) mice out-performed untreated wild type mice (WT_t0, Fig. 2)."

ALL_PANELS,"Because of this bidirectional transfer of cells, a woman may host cells of fetal origin from her pregnancies and cells of maternal origin from her own mother (Figure 1).2 Furthermore, the same woman might host other cells transferred from her mother during fetal life, including cells possibly stemming from older siblings, a vanishing twin, or prior maternal termination of pregnancy,2,8,9 and even cells of neither fetal nor maternal origin stemming from maternal blood transfusion.9 Not all papers, however, demonstrate increased cFMC of older sibling origin, and further research is needed to uncover all potential sources of microchimerism in women.10
Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"With both methods, the Y-chromosome is still often employed as a target for identifying microchimeric cells (Figure 2).2 FISH visualizes the cells in the context of surrounding maternal tissue, but is costly and time consuming."
ALL_PANELS,"Real-time PCR is simpler and more time efficient.11 With either method, the researcher may compare not only the prevalence of cFMC in different groups but also whether the relative quantities of cFMC differ in each subject (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,This allows for microchimerism detection by FISH or by qPCR probes targeting the Y-chromosome (as shown here).Figure 3.
ALL_PANELS,"These probes are used to target paternally inherited fetal DNA sequences that the mother does not possess (Figure 4), thereby detecting microchimerism from male and female fetuses."
ALL_PANELS,"Boddy et al. hypothesize that cFMC may affect lactation, maternal thermoregulation, and mother–child bonding.6 Firstly, they cite a study showing that fetal microchimeric fibroblasts from mice differentiate into mammary epithelial cells when exposed to lactation hormones in vitro46 and another study showing that 56% of healthy parous women carry cFMC in their mammary tissue.47 Secondly, they present evidence that cFMC persists after pregnancy in maternal thyroid tissue48 and speculate that fetal cells may upregulate maternal body temperature in women with newborn infants.6 Finally, based on evidence that fetal cells in maternal mouse brains can differentiate into mature neurons49 and that cFMC may be found in the female human brain,50 they propose an evolutionary role for cFMC in strengthening the emotional tie between mother and child.6The impact of cFMC in inducing immunotolerance during pregnancy and temporary secondary effects on autoimmune disease
In addition to modulating maternal body function postpartum, maternal acquisition of fetal genetic material has been proposed to play a role in inducing materno-fetal tolerance during pregnancy, a factor potentially contributing to why certain autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are temporarily ameliorated during pregnancy.24 In 1993, a study by Nelson et al. looked into fetal–maternal disparity in HLA class II molecules,51 a concept illustrated in Figure 4."

ALL_PANELS,Figure 2 illustrates the association between controllable variables and infection probability across various exposure durations.
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 2 displays that, in any case, the infection probability curve was black, pink, blue, and orange, from top to bottom, representing activity levels and breathing types of light activity, singing/speaking loudly; heavy exercise, oral breathing; light activity, speaking; and resting, oral breathing, respectively."
2a,"Using Figure 2A(a) as a reference, in the case of poorly ventilated, unvaccinated (or without previous infection), without wearing a mask and exposure for 3 h, the probability of infection in the combination of four activity levels and breathing types was 92.97%, 60.2%, 30.39%, and 8.04%, respectively, which indicated that, in the place of light activity and speaking/singing loudly, the probability of infection for contacts was as high as 90%, significantly higher than the probabilities associated with other combinations of activity levels and breathing types."
ALL_PANELS,"The data presented in Figure 2 demonstrate that the probability of infection for contacts in a given setting was consistently higher when masks were not worn, as indicated by the solid lines consistently above the dashed line."
2a,"Specifically, under the conditions of Figure 2A(a) with an exposure time of 0.5 h, the probability of infection for various activity types and breathing levels was approximately twice as high without masks compared to with masks."
2a,"In Figure 2A(a), taking light activity, singing/speaking loudly had the highest probability of infection; as an example, when ACH = 0.5, without a mask, exposure time of 3 h, unvaccinated, the probability of infection was 92.97%; when ACH = 3, the probability of infection was 35.90%; when ACH = 10, the probability of infection was 12.05%."
2a,"Taking light activity, singing/speaking loudly, as an example, Figure 2A(a),B(a) shows that when poorly ventilated, without masks, and with an exposure time of 3 h, the infection probability of contacts of vaccination (or previous infection) was 72.00% and the probability of infection was 92.97% for those who were not vaccinated."

ALL_PANELS,"For example, querying the phenotypic item “hypertension” returns the tree numbers that map to the natural language headings: “hypertension, malignant”; “hypertension, portal”; “hypertension, pulmonary”; “hypertension, renal”; “hypertension”; “masked hypertension”; “prehypertension”; etc (shown in Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"An example of a ranked synonym set can be seen in Figure 3.Corpus Analysis
The aim of the corpus analysis step is to gauge the strength of the relationship between items in a phenotype."
ALL_PANELS,"In PIVET, the lift calculation entails dividing the percentage of times items appear together in the corpus by the product of percentages of times each item appears individually in the corpus, which can be rewritten as equation 2 in Figure 4, where count(A) is the number of articles in the corpus that contain the set A, and D is the number of documents in the corpus."
ALL_PANELS,"The number of subsets that had zero occurrences in the corpus is calculated using a simple combinatorial formula as shown in equation 3 in Figure 4, where S^j is the number of phenotypic items in phenotype j."
ALL_PANELS,"In conjunction with Figure 5 and Table 2, the results suggest that not all of the PheKnow-Cloud articles are relevant or directly related to the phenotypic item."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 6 plots the pooled normalized lift values for the 80 phenotypes based on the annotated significance level.
ALL_PANELS,"In the second set of experiments, we use PIVET’s full framework (Figure 1) to predict which phenotypes are clinically valid and show how PIVET can be used to examine phenotypes that are possibly clinically valid."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 7 illustrates the differences in the mean lift values between the various categories, with the gold and silver standard separated from the clinically significant group."
ALL_PANELS,"The yearly number of eligible non-English-language studies published in each journal has increased significantly over time, especially since 2000, in 6 out of the 12 languages covered (French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and simplified Chinese), with Portuguese and Russian showing a particularly rapid increase, while traditional Chinese also showed a marginally significant increase (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Studies in 10 out of the 16 languages we searched were significantly more likely to adopt less robust designs, compared to English-language studies, when controlling for the effect of study taxa and countries where English-language studies were conducted (Fig 2 and S1 Table)."
ALL_PANELS,"English-language studies were conducted in a total of 952 of the 2° × 2° grid cells and non-English-language studies in 353 grid cells, 238 of which had no English-language studies (those grid cells shown in black in Fig 3; also see Comparing study locations in Materials and methods)."
ALL_PANELS,"More non-English-language studies tended to be found in grid cells with fewer English-language studies, especially in East/Central/Western Asia, Russia, northern Africa, and Latin America (Figs 3 and S2), but the relationship was not significant when controlling for spatial autocorrelation (posterior median slope in a conditional autoregressive model: −0.012, 95% credible interval (CI): −0.032 to 0.005; see an inset in Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although species with more studies in non-English languages also tended to have more studies in English for all 3 taxa (generalised linear mixed models for amphibians: slope = 0.12, z = 7.93, p < 0.001; birds: slope = 0.060, z = 13.18, p < 0.001; mammals: slope = 0.026, z = 5.65, p < 0.001; also see insets in Fig 4), non-English-language studies provided scientific evidence on the effectiveness of conservation interventions for an additional 9 amphibian, 217 bird, and 64 mammal species that were not covered by English-language studies (Fig 4), meaning 5%, 32%, and 9% increases in the evidence coverage of amphibian, bird, and mammal species, respectively."
ALL_PANELS,"We thus assessed the effects of excluding earlier volumes of long-running journals from our searches, by testing how the number of eligible studies changed over time in each journal (see Fig 1 for the result).


· Possibility of missing eligible studies
We tried to identify as many eligible studies as possible in each language, by making sure that (i) every searcher was well qualified and trained before starting the searches (see Searchers); and (ii) when in doubt, searchers keep, rather than reject, a study as potentially eligible, the validity of which was later assessed by independent experts (see Study validity assessment)."
ALL_PANELS,This would potentially affect the reported patterns in (i) the number and proportion of eligible studies among non-English languages (S1 Fig); and (ii) the proportion of different study designs among different languages (Fig 2).
ALL_PANELS,"Nevertheless, among-searcher variations in judgements should affect neither (i) yearly increases in the number of eligible non-English-language studies in each journal (Fig 1), as the same journal was searched by a single searcher, nor (ii) the spatial and taxonomic complementarity between English- and non-English-language studies (Figs 3 and 4), assuming that any such variations in assessment outcomes only affected a limited number of non-English-language studies and thus have not drastically changed the overall patterns in the differences between English and non-English-language studies.


· Effects of publication bias
We focused only on studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals and thus did not consider the effects of publication bias, caused by ignoring grey literature, within each language, while recognising that important scientific knowledge may also be published in non-English-language grey literature [29]."
ALL_PANELS,"Journals with 30 or fewer studies screened were excluded from this calculation, as the estimated proportions would be unreliable given the small sample size.Testing yearly changes in the number of eligible non-English-language studies
To test whether the number of eligible non-English-language studies had changed over time, we focused only on journals with 10 or more eligible studies, resulting in journals/studies in a total of 12 languages (shown in Fig 1) being used in the following analysis."
ALL_PANELS,The representative area covered by a grid cell in temperate areas is smaller than at the tropics and many of the new grids cells in Fig3 are tropical.

7a,We obtained the list of nine genera from the study of bacteria associated with the gill tissues of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Eastern oyster [52].The findings on Arcobacter genomes with complete denitrification traits (Figure 7a) as well as the recommendation for research on Arcobacter strains and their hosts [56] led us to construct a denitrification potential dataset for 127 genomes taxonomically classified to the bacteria family Arcobacteraceae.
ALL_PANELS,"The ecosystem classification and counts of genomes according to denitrification potential revealed Arcobacteraceae strains inhabit engineered, environmental, and host-associated ecosystems (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"We observed seven bacteria phyla: Acidobacteriota (1 genome), Actinomycetota (2 genomes), Bacteroidota (36 genomes), Campylobacterota (63 genomes), Myxococcota (1 genome), Nitrospirota (2 genomes), and Pseudomonadota (3175 genomes) (Figure 9)."
ALL_PANELS,"The phyla Campylobacterota and Pseudomonadota have genera associated with Mollusca (shellfish).Since Arcobacteraceae is a member of the Campylobacterota and since denitrifying Arcobacteraceae strains have been isolated from oysters (Figure 9), we conducted a literature search on the other Campylobacterota families with genomes categorized as having complete denitrification potential."

ALL_PANELS,The most widely applied key drivers influencing the rate of CHE in these studies have been shown in Figure 2.
ALL_PANELS,We present maps and summaries of these predictions by each of the nine USEPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys reporting regions (Fig. 1).
ALL_PANELS,This process was repeated to produce an MMI assessment for each of the nine assessment regions (Fig. 1) with a unique set of metrics and reference sites used in each region.
2a,StreamCat data are available at two scales: local catchments and full-contributing watersheds (Fig. 2A).
2b,"In this example, information from catchments 2 and 3 would then be linked to the split catchment to produce site-specific watershed data.Sample-specific watersheds
Many NRSA sample sites fell well above the outlet of the NHDPlusV2 stream segments (Fig. 2B)."
2b,"We used these flow rasters to delineate upstream contributing areas within these local catchment, thereby creating a site-specific catchment for these samples (i.e., dark grey area in Fig. 2B)."
2b,"We then overlaid these site-specific catchments onto the same set of geospatial layers used by Hill et al. (2016), and topologically linked them to upstream catchments (i.e., catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 2B) to calculate a suite of predictors for each NRSA site that matched the set of StreamCat metrics described above and in Appendix S2.Model development
We used RFs (Breiman 2001) to model and predict the probability of streams being in good biological condition."
ALL_PANELS,"National versus regional models
We compared a single, national model with models that were developed for each of the nine regions (i.e., a unique model for each region in Fig. 1)."
2b,"We then overlaid these site-specific catchments onto the same set of geospatial layers used by Hill et al. (2016), and topologically linked them to upstream catchments (i.e., catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 2B) to calculate a suite of predictors for each NRSA site that matched the set of StreamCat metrics described above and in Appendix S2."
2b,"Sample-specific watersheds
Many NRSA sample sites fell well above the outlet of the NHDPlusV2 stream segments (Fig. 2B)."
ALL_PANELS,"We compared a single, national model with models that were developed for each of the nine regions (i.e., a unique model for each region in Fig. 1)."
3a,"For example, almost all Pr(good) values produced by the national model in the Coastal Plains region were below 0.5, even for sites that were assessed by NRSA to be in good condition (Fig. 3A)."
3b,"The opposite pattern was observed for sites in the Western Mountains region, where the model over predicted Pr(good) values of true poor sites (Fig. 3B)."
"c, d","Regional boxplots showed Pr(good) values that were unbiased, i.e., generally centered on Pr(0.5) (see Fig. 3C-D for example)."
ALL_PANELS,"Mean, standard deviation, and median of predicted probabilities of good biological condition by EPA National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) reporting region (see Fig. 1) and for the conterminous US (CONUS)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the border between the Southern Appalachian and Coastal Plains regions was marked by a shift from lower to higher values of Pr(good), respectively (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, in the Potomac watershed (Fig. 6), catchments in Coastal Plains were comprised of similar or higher amounts of urbanization than catchments in Southern Appalachian at the regional boundary."
ALL_PANELS,"In the Northern Plains region, larger rivers that received much of their flow from the Bitterroot Mountains (western edge of Northern Plains; Fig 7) continued to have higher values of Pr(good) relative to adjacent first-order streams despite passing through land that is dominated by agriculture (Fig. 5)."
2a,"In addition, the definition of Flotemersch et al. (2015) was extended to local catchments within the NHDPlusV2 (see Fig. 2A for definitions of catchments and watersheds) to generate a national map of catchment integrity (ICI; index of catchment integrity)."
ALL_PANELS,"As an illustration, we selected streams that were within the upper 95th percentile of Pr(good) values within each region and mapped them by their Strahler stream order (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"For headwater streams, we excluded the criteria of IWI > 0.75 because the catchment and watershed are the same geographic unit (Fig. 2), and restoration of the ICI would result in a commensurate increase in IWI as well."
ALL_PANELS,"This query identified more than 7,300 km of streams within the CONUS that met these criteria (see Table 4 and Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, more than half of these stream lengths (4,659 km) were within the Temperate Plains region alone and were almost entirely comprised of 1st order catchments (Fig. 8), suggesting that local restoration efforts could substantially improve biological conditions within the upper Mississippi Basin."
ALL_PANELS,"The development of nine regional models ameliorated biases across regions, but produced sharp changes in predicted condition at regional borders (Fig. 6) and this pattern further supports the use and interpretation of NRSA MMIs on a regional, rather than national, basis."
1c,They experimentally demonstrated that the optical forces (parameterized by the trapping factor Q) acting on a NP:Ln depend on the electrostatic properties (zeta potential) of the interface between the NP and the surrounding medium more strongly than on their volume (see expression 2 and Figure 1C).
"d, t","As shown in Figure 1D, they employed this strategy to measure the length of single bacterium by co-trapping in a row a KLu2F7:Yb,Er NP:Ln of 120 nm (with a trap stiffness of 14.1 pN/m W), a single E. coli bacterium, and then a second NP:Ln (12.8 pN/mW)."
3a,"Additionally, eleven of twelve students self-identified as a scientist, and ten of twelve students self-identified as a researcher (Fig. 3A)."
3b,"In accordance with this sense of scientific identity, the majority of the students expressed a high degree of confidence in general skills (“I can usually understand the main points of a scientific journal article” and “I am confident in my ability to find a scientific journal article online”, mean response of “agree” for each statement) (Fig. 3B)."
3c,"Despite their previous research experience and high degree of confidence in general skills, seven of twelve indicated that they had never presented a critique of a scientific journal article, and only two of twelve agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I regularly read scientific journal articles” (Fig. 3C)."
ALL_PANELS,The majority of the students sampled had taken more than three courses that included exposure to primary scientific literature (Fig. 5).
ALL_PANELS,"At our institution, a public, comprehensive, historically American Indian university, within a group of high achieving students who plan to attend medical or graduate school, the majority had not taken any classes that included reading and/or discussion of primary scientific literature (Fig. 5)."
3c,"In contrast, the mean response to the statement “I regularly read scientific journal articles” increased significantly (Fig. 3C)."
ALL_PANELS,The J–N regions of significance displayed in Figure 1 show that nostalgia increased activated PA at resilience values higher than 5.58 (+0.57 SD) and decreased it at resilience values lower than 2.50 (−2.22 SD).

"a, b","The SLF undergoes a large change in body size, quadrupling in length [15] and progressing through four wingless nymphal stages (instars) in three to four months before emerging as a winged adult [17] (figure 1a,b)."
"c, d","The SLF's preferred host, the Ailanthus altissima tree, has dense layered foliage consisting of pinnately compound leaflets (figure 1c,d) that likely offer numerous landing targets for falling insects."
1b,"Specimen body length, L = 11.8 mm [10.3, 12.6] mm (mean, range) (figure 1b), was measured to ±0.05 mm either using digital calipers (model SV-03-150, E-base Measuring Tools, Yunlin, Taiwan) or using the measure function in ImageJ [30] on digital photographs including a millimetre-ruled scale."
ALL_PANELS,"Body masses, m = 66 ± 18 mg, [40, 100] mg (N = 16, mean ± s.d., range), were measured to ±0.4 mg with an analytical balance (Explorer, Ohaus, Parsippany, NJ, USA). (See electronic supplementary material, table S1, for morphometric data.)

2a,"Live and dead specimens were released using featherweight entomology tweezers (DRENTF01, DR Instruments, Palos Hills, IL, USA) (figure 2a) oriented side, head down or caudal end down, similar to methods used in [11,32]."
1c,We also note that this choice of falling distance lies in the range of distances between neighbouring leaflets in A. altissima trees (figure 1c).
2a,"We divided each falling trial into four periods for analysis: aerial, impact, post-impact and final landing (figure 2a)."
2b,Specimen orientation at the initial impact and final landing (i.e. after coming to rest post-impact) was scored by frame-by-frame video analysis into the best agreement with five categories similar to definitions used in [11] (figure 2b).
2c,"In the following, a body axis is referred to as ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ when it agrees with the respective direction within 45°, e.g. a horizontal cranial–caudal axis corresponds to θ ≤ ±45° (figure 2c)."
ALL_PANELS,"To determine whether release orientation impacted the distribution of orientations on impact and final landing, we considered three orientation outcomes for impact: upright, upside-down and other (comprising side, caudal and head down); and two for landing: upright and upside-down (figure 3)."
4a,"Aerial phase
Figure 4a shows a typical sequence of motions by live SLF nymphs during the aerial phase of the dropping experiments (electronic supplementary material, movie S1)."
4b,"In the majority of trials (97.1% = 135/139) artificially released specimens assumed a stereotypical falling posture within 0.079 s [0.029, 0.129] s after release, in which they spread their legs fully and held them slightly above the dorsal plane until impact (figure 4b)."
5b,"We were successful at filming a total of 15 voluntary release trials for five specimens from 354 mm [342, 365] mm above the hard substrate (figure 5b)."
4c,"All falling trajectories for all conditions agreed well with a quadratic drag model (R2 ≥ 0.9998; fit residuals 0.9 mm [0.7, 1.0] mm) (figure 4c)."
4d,"Terminal speed did not differ significantly between live specimens released voluntarily and artificially (Tukey's HSD, p = 0.48) (figure 4d)."
4d,"Dead specimens with their legs tucked had a mean terminal velocity that was greater than and statistically different from all other conditions (i.e. live and dead with legs spread) (Tukey's HSD, p < 0.0001), whereas analysis of live and dead with legs spread found no significant differences (Tukey's HSD, p > 0.74) (figure 4d)."
5a,"The rotation rate after release, Ωrel, of live specimens was significantly larger than for dead specimens (one-sided t-test p = 2.4 × 10−5 versus dead with legs spread and p = 0.0013 versus dead with legs tucked) (figure 5a)."
5b,"To illustrate how rotation rate changed during falling, we computed the change in rotation rate magnitude, Δ|Ω|, at the midpoint and impact relative to its value at release (figure 5b)."
7a,"While we were unable to release specimens above leaves reproducibly enough to study their impact and landing distributions per se, we did film 49 trials in which 15 different nymphs landed successfully on A. altissima leaves (1–6 landings/specimen) (figure 7a)."

Are any acoustic features reliably different between song and speech across cultures?
1) Song uses higher pitch than speech

n = 81 pairs of audio recordings of song/speech, with each pair sung/spoken by the same person (Fig. 2)."
2b,"We did not collect standardized information about the function/context of songs, but the word clouds of lyrics translated to English (compare Fig. 2B) may provide an idea about what the songs are about, as do the English translations of the spoken descriptions (all available with other data at https://osf.io/mzxc8)."
ALL_PANELS,We compared the following six acoustic features (Fig. 3; compare the “Features” section in the Supplementary Materials for details) between song and speech for our main confirmatory analyses:.
ALL_PANELS,The results of the confirmatory hypothesis testing with 73 recording sets confirmed five of our six predictions (Fig. 4 and table S1; all P < 1 × 10−5).
ALL_PANELS,"This is an alternative visualization of the same sung/spoken data from Fig. 4, but showing mean values of each feature rather than paired differences, and now also including data for instrumental melodies and recited lyrics."
ALL_PANELS,"Note that the colors of data points indicate language families, which are coded the same as in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,We performed two exploratory analyses using automated methods to investigate (i) the reproducibility of our findings with another corpus and (ii) the applicability of automated methods to substitute data extraction processes involving manual work (Fig. 6; compare the “Exploring recording representativeness and automated scalability” section in the Supplementary Materials).
ALL_PANELS,"Similar to Fig. 5, mean values of each feature per recording can be found in the Supplementary Materials (figs."
ALL_PANELS,"However, only three to four f0 slopes (equal to the number of “phrases” or intervals from the first onset after a break and to the next break; compare Fig. 3) are, on average, included in the 20-s length recording of singing and spoken description, respectively, and so it is possible that this failed prediction could be due to the relatively more limited amount of data available for this feature."
ALL_PANELS,"Last, we also checked the average trend of f0 contours segmented by onset and break annotations (compare Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, on average, spoken pitch contours tend to descend more than sung pitch contours, explaining our failure to confirm our prediction that their contours would display similar pitch declination (compare Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"We also noticed that vocalizers sometimes end their utterance by raising pitch in their spoken description recordings (and lyrics recitation as well), causing a slight rise at the end of the averaged f0 contour of spoken description (and lyrics recitation; compare Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"The details of the computation is provided in the “Computation of average f0 contours of Fig. 7” section in the Supplementary Materials.Furthermore, the width of SEs around the mean contour (compare Fig. 7) suggests that spoken description and lyrics recitation have more homogeneous variations of contours than song and instrumental."
ALL_PANELS,The details of the computation is provided in the “Computation of average f0 contours of Fig. 7” section in the Supplementary Materials.
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the width of SEs around the mean contour (compare Fig. 7) suggests that spoken description and lyrics recitation have more homogeneous variations of contours than song and instrumental."
ALL_PANELS,"Main confirmatory predictions and their robustness
Our analyses strongly support five of our six predictions across an unprecedentedly diverse global sample of music/speech recordings: (i) Song uses higher pitch than speech, (ii) song is slower than speech, (iii) song uses more stable pitches than speech, (iv) song and speech use similar timbral brightness, and (v) song and speech use similar sized pitch intervals (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the first three features display a shift of distribution along the musi-linguistic continuum, with instrumental melodies tending to use even higher and more stable pitches than song and lyric recitation tending to fall in between conversational speech and song (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4 shows many exceptions for four of the five features: for example, Parselelo (Kiswahili speaker) sang with a lower pitch than he spoke, and Ozaki (Japanese speaker) used slightly more stable pitches when speaking than singing, while many recording sets had examples where differences in sung versus spoken timbre or interval size were substantially larger than our designated SESOI."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead of our predicted similarities, our exploratory analyses suggest that, while both song and speech contours tend to decline toward the end of a breath, they tend to do so in different ways: song first rising before falling to end near the same height as the beginning, speech first descending before briefly rising at the end (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Analysis of Hilton et al.’s (26) dataset of field recordings also supplemented our findings, producing qualitatively identical conclusions, regardless of the precise analysis methods or specific sample/subsample used (Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our analyses strongly support five of our six predictions across an unprecedentedly diverse global sample of music/speech recordings: (i) Song uses higher pitch than speech, (ii) song is slower than speech, (iii) song uses more stable pitches than speech, (iv) song and speech use similar timbral brightness, and (v) song and speech use similar sized pitch intervals (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"In general, many features followed the predicted “musi-linguistic continuum” with instrumental music and spoken conversation most extreme (e.g., most/least stable pitches respectively), with song and lyric recitation occupying intermediate positions (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"These differences were consistent even when analyzed using matching subsamples speaking the same languages and using the same fully automated analysis methods (Fig. 6), suggesting that they are not due to differences in the sample of languages or analysis methods we chose."
ALL_PANELS,"At the same time, we were surprised to find that the two features that differed most between song and speech were not pitch stability and rhythmic regularity but rather pitch height and temporal rate (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Since our main interest lies in the identification of which features demonstrate differences or similarities between song and speech, we perform the within-participants comparison of the six features between the pairs of singing and speech, using the spoken description rather than the lyric recitation as the proxy for speech (compare red boxes in Fig. 1; the comparisons with lyrics recitation and with instrumental versions are saved for exploratory analyses)."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, terms in the computed difference scores are arranged so that for our predicted differences (H1 to H3), a positive value indicates a difference in the predicted direction (compare Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,We apply the meta-analysis framework to synthesize the effect size across recordings to make statistical inference for each hypothesis (Fig. 8).
ALL_PANELS,"Among male students, a significant association was observed between high GNC and PSU severity (Fig. 1)."

ALL_PANELS,"So far, the closest attempt to decompose statistics in this manner is the STATO statistical ontology (http://stato-ontology.org/), which can be used to semantically, rather than programmatically or mathematically, define all aspects of a statistical model and its results, including assumptions, variables, covariates, and parameters (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"CWL manages the exacting specification of file inputs, outputs, parameters that are ""operational metadata"" used by the workflow machinery to communicate with the shell and executable software (Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Application profiles follow along the Singapore Framework (Figure 7), and guidelines supported by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)."
ALL_PANELS,"A good example is the tximeta Bioconductor package (Figure 8), which implements reference transcriptome provenance for RNA-sequencing experiments, extending a number of popular transcript quantification tools with checksum-based tracking and identification.219 While this is an elegant solution, tximeta is focused on one analysis pattern."
ALL_PANELS,"In the wake of this newfound interest in reproducibility, both the variety and volume of related case studies increased after 2015 (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"VAT was measured by interpretation of whole body MRIs, and serum leptin levels were determined in blood samples.Fig. 2."

ALL_PANELS,Using a truncated y−axis more clearly shows the upward trend in the use of acronyms in titles for all article types over time (by reducing the influence of ‘other’ in the 1950s and 1960s; see Figure 1—figure supplement 2).
ALL_PANELS,"Moreover, when the 100 most popular acronyms were removed, there was still a clear increase in acronym use over time (Figure 1—figure supplement 1)."

ALL_PANELS,"Overview of physical mechanisms
To facilitate explaining the mechanisms of pollutant transport for the different designs adopted in this study, Figure 4 shows the velocity, TKE and concentration contours for selected cases, organized as follows: the contours are listed vertically in order of increasing LAD, and horizontally the contours on the left are without fence, while those on the right are the same designs when combined with fence."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4:

Open in a new tab
Contours at 3 ms−1 for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only LAD 0.75 (Case 7), vegetation only LAD 1.5 (Case 8), fence only far from highway (Case 3), vegetation LAD 0.75 followed by 3m fence (Case 10), and vegetation LAD 1.5 followed by 3m fence (case 11) (a) Velocity; (b) TKE; (c) Normalized concentration."
ALL_PANELS,"Overall, cases with vegetation see 1) low velocity within the vegetation and accelerated flow around it (Figure 4a, Cases 7 and 8) compared to the no barrier case (Figure 4a, Case 1), 2) a region of reduced velocity (Figure 4a, Cases 7 and 8) and TKE (Figure 4b, Cases 7 and 8) right immediately behind the vegetation, referred to as “Low-TKE zone”, via short circuiting of turbulence by the vegetation (Poggi et al., 2004; Raupach and Thom, 1981; Finnigan, 2000), and 3) a “High-TKE zone”, after the Low-TKE zone, as a result of the turbulence produced from the shear at the vegetation top edge and in the wake."
4b,"In addition, clearly shown on the velocity contours (Figure 4b), denser vegetation (i.e., LAD = 1.5) leads to more drag imposed on the flow, which creates a “Recirculation Zone” in the vegetation wake (Case 8) that was not observed for vegetation with LAD = 0.75 (Case 7)."
"c, c","In terms of the concentration fields, pollutant dispersion is weak in the Low-TKE zone and the concentration roughly plateaus (Figure 4c, Cases 7 and 8, “Concentration plateau”)."
"a, c","Furthermore, the fence generates a recirculation region behind it (Figure 4a, Case 3, “Fence recirculation”)."
"b, c","The recirculation along with the shear generated at the fence top edge produces TKE immediately behind the barrier as depicted in Figure 4b, Case 3 (“Fence TKE”), which disperses pollutants and generates a well-mixed region behind the fence."
"b, c","When the fence is combined with vegetation it promotes vertical dispersion of pollutants and produces TKE immediately behind the vegetation (Figure 4b, Cases 10 and 11, “Fence TKE”), which effectively mitigates the plateau region observed for the vegetation only cases."
ALL_PANELS,"When the vegetation is less dense, the fence produces more turbulence since the velocity reaching the fence is higher due to less drag (Figure 4b, Cases 10) than the corresponding values for the denser vegetation case (Figure 4b, Cases 11)."
ALL_PANELS,"To facilitate explaining the mechanisms of pollutant transport for the different designs adopted in this study, Figure 4 shows the velocity, TKE and concentration contours for selected cases, organized as follows: the contours are listed vertically in order of increasing LAD, and horizontally the contours on the left are without fence, while those on the right are the same designs when combined with fence."

4a,The dashed black line on Figure 4a highlights the plateau region behind the barrier for the vegetation only (Case 8) where there is reduced pollutant dispersion.
ALL_PANELS,"Pollutant reduction depends on the particle size and location behind the barrier.Table S2 in the SI provides the overall reduction of all the tested designs compared to the No barrier case integrated over a volume that spans horizontally from 0 to 100 m behind the barrier and vertically from 0 to 2 m above the ground, as illustrated in Figure 2."

ALL_PANELS,"For vegetation only (Case 8) after the plateau region, there is a strong concentration reduction (Figure 5) from the high TKE generated behind the barrier as shown in Figure 4b, Case 8."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 5 displays the downwind concentration behind the barrier for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only (Case 8) and vegetation followed by 3m fence (Case 11)."
ALL_PANELS,Our results indicate that combining less dense vegetation with fence (Case 10) can have similar reduction in pollutant concentrations to that of a denser vegetation only barrier (Case 8) as illustrated in Figure 7.
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 7:

"c, c","Since the plateau region is longer for vegetation with LAD 0.75 (Figure 4c, Cases 10 and 11), adding a fence is advantageous because it results in enhanced reduction for a substantial distance behind the barrier."
8a,"Our results are consistent with those findings as smaller particles experienced reductions regardless of wind speed, whereas larger particles experienced an increase or no reduction in concentrations (Figure 8a)."

8a,"Figure 8a shows that for particle size 15 nm, for vegetation and vegetation with fence designs there are substantial reduction compared to the no barrier case."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 8 further demonstrates that a combination of a vegetation and fence results in more reduction of pollutants and adding a fence to the vegetative barrier at 1 ms−1 ensures that there is almost no harm being caused by the vegetative barrier.
8b,"At 1 ms−1 (Case 9), the plateau region in the vegetation-only case, where little dispersion occurs due to reduced velocity and TKE, extends for roughly 20 m (Figure 8b)."

What stands out? What do you notice about the whole map?
B

This is not a dense network
Much of the contact between network members is very infrequent (see Fig. 1)


Relationships need to be enhanced but members do not want more frequent meetings
Communication can improve by incorporating discussion of young parents’ needs into existing meetings



What do you notice about your organization and its relationship to other organizations?
B
Most collaboration occurs at less intensive levels (networking, cooperation)

More intensive levels of collaboration are not always needed for effective relationships
The Pathways project is an opportunity for network members to identify the most effective intensity of collaboration needed



Which organizations are ‘key players’?
C

This is a dense network; most organizations know each other (see all maps in Fig. 2)
High degree centralization means a small number of organizations are central to the network
Overall contact is infrequent and collaboration occurs at a lower intensity meaning fewer “key players.”
There are some organizations on the periphery, connected to few or no other organizations


A connection should be established and then strengthened with organizations on the periphery of this network
Future conversations will focus on developing collaboration

ALL_PANELS,"Study Area
The study area includes four distinct basins (Figure 1), of which Drin and Drina are river basins and Prespa and Skadar are lake basins."
3a,"Functional components
The functional components (Figure 3A) reflect the integrity of the individual environmental systems of a watershed."
3b,"The regions with the lowest ICI values (Fig. 3B) were near the confluence of the Drina and the Sava and in NW Albania, while those with the highest ICI values were within the Dinaric Alps (central Montenegro, SE Bosnia, N and E Albania)."
ALL_PANELS,"In terms of biogeographic zones (Figure 1), the mean Alpine ICI was 0.53 (SD = 0.15), the mean ICI of the Mediterranean Zone was 0.46 (SD = 0.18), and the mean ICI of the Continental Zone was 0.34 (SD = 0.13)."
ALL_PANELS,"Similar to the ICI results, IWI spatial trends (Figure 3C) were largely influenced by biogeographic zone (Figure 1)."
3a,This variability between the functional components (Figure 3A) can be useful to national managers (see 4.2 Management Applications).
ALL_PANELS,"Given that cultural services such as recreation or stewardship are regularly managed at the local scale (Plieninger et al. 2013), whereas regulating services, such as river flood mitigation, are often managed at the national or international scale (Stürck et al. 2014), the levels of information provided by the ICI and the IWI of streams, watersheds, and basins inform the respective local, national, and international management entities (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,The three levels of information additionally accommodate scientific recommendations to manage aquatic features at multiple ecological scales (Figure 4) (Allan et al. 1997; De Groot et al. 2010).
3a,"By identifying the functional component with the lowest value in an individual catchment or watershed, the national management authority can identify the individual source(s) of stress (Figure 3A)."
3d,Hill et al. (Hill et al. 2017) suggest that the success of biological resource management would increase if management targeted areas with low catchment integrity and high watershed integrity (Figure 3D).
3d,"To increase restoration feasibility, managers can identify catchments with high IWI values (the blue and green catchments identified in Figure 3D)."
ALL_PANELS,"The study area includes four distinct basins (Figure 1), of which Drin and Drina are river basins and Prespa and Skadar are lake basins."
3a,The functional components (Figure 3A) reflect the integrity of the individual environmental systems of a watershed.
ALL_PANELS,"A subsequent surgical debridement was performed (Fig 1) during which sampled tissue was subjected to further microbiological testing, including being sent for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and mycobacterial culture."
ALL_PANELS,An X-ray of the affected finger confirmed changes consistent with osteomyelitis of the middle and proximal phalanges (Fig 2).
ALL_PANELS,"A red mark on the inner side of his right upper arm evolved into a small ulcer by late June, suggesting an incubation period of four to five weeks (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"The core genome tree distinctly delineated the Batemans Bay isolates, setting them apart from the clinical isolates in Victoria in their own clade (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, the isolates from Batemans Bay and Far East Gippsland are situated on a distinct branch of the phylogenetic tree, which merges at the most recent common ancestor of M. ulcerans in south-eastern Australia (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"The relatively long branch length of the Batemans Bay M. ulcerans genomes, revealed by the phylogenomic analysis, is consistent with—as yet—unsampled genetically diverse M. ulcerans present on other areas of Australia (Fig 6)."

Risk of Bias
The risk of bias assessment for individual studies is presented in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"Positive parenting interventions led to significant improvements in children’s mental abilities, based on 5746 participants (g = 0.46; 95% CI 0.32, 0.61, p < 0.0001, k = 33; Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Studies that were scored as having a higher risk of bias yielded larger effect sizes than those that were rated as having a lower risk of bias (β =  − 0.07, CI − 0.13, − 0.003, p < 0.05, z = − 2.07; Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Higher scores on risk of bias represents lower risk of biasWhen statistically significant moderators (risk of bias scores and method of assessment) were simultaneously entered into a meta-regression, risk of bias was significant (β =  − 0.07, CI − 0.13, − 0.004, p < 0.05, z = − 2.09), and instrument measurement was reduced to p < 0.10 (β =  − 0.32, CI − 0.70, 0.06, z =  − 1.64).Language
Based on a meta-analysis of 30 studies (n = 6248), positive parenting interventions led to significant gains in children’s language skills (g = 0.25, 95% CI 0.14, 0.35, p < 0.0001; Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill procedure indicated six studies imputed to balance reported positive intervention effects, based on random effects models (adjusted point estimate = 0.16 (95% CI 0.05, 0.27; Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Sample A (Clarke et al., 2012; Sheridan et al., 2011); Sample B (Jeong et al., 2019; Obradovic et al., 2016; Yousafzai et al., 2014; Yousafzai et al., 2016); Sample D (Brennan et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2017; Connell et al., 2019; Lunkenheimer et al., 2008); Sample F (Green et al., 2015; Green et al., 2017); Sample G (Bagner et al., 2016; Garcia et al., 2019; Heymann et al., 2020); Sample H (Kaaresen et al., 2008; Nordhov et al., 2010); Sample I (Koldewijn et al., 2010; van Hus et al., 2013; Verkerk et al., 2012); Sample K (Slaughter et al., 1979; Slaughter et al., 1983)Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"Moderation analyses, presented in Table 7, showed that younger children made more gains than older children (β = − 0.01, CI − 0.01, − 0.002, p < 0.01, z = − 2.78; Fig. 7)."

Meta-regression of Hedge’s g on child age (at baseline) for language meta-analysisWhen child age (at baseline), parental education, and father involvement were entered into a meta-regression simultaneously, child age at baseline (β = − 0.01, CI − 0.01, − 0.0003, z = − 1.85) was reduced to near-significance (p = 0.06), whereas parental education and father involvement were no longer significant moderators.Executive Functioning
There were 14 studies (n = 3628) included in the meta-analysis of executive functioning outcomes, with results indicating a nonsignificant pooled effect size (g = 0.07; 95% CI − 0.09, 0.23, ns; Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"When controlling for baseline child age, parental age was reduced to p < 0.10.Pre-Academics
A meta-analysis of studies that included an outcome assessment of pre-academics (k = 7; n = 2365) yielded a positive but nonsignificant pooled effect (g = 0.16; 95% CI − 0.03 0.34, p < 0.10; Fig. 9)."

ALL_PANELS,"After doing this, each window contains the aperture domain data for multiple frequencies, and the completion of this step corresponds to the completion of (A) in Fig. 1."
ALL_PANELS,"In this case, 115,200 total model fits must be performed, so each one of these model fits will be assigned to one thread as shown in Fig. 4."
ALL_PANELS,The solid red lines represent minimizing the objective function with respect to one model coefficient at a time.Fig. 4.
ALL_PANELS,"Note that in Fig. 2, image display is listed under CPU due to the fact that MATLAB is used to display the processed image."
ALL_PANELS,"CPU ADMIRE vs. GPU ADMIRE Benchmarks
Fig. 6 shows the simulated cyst dataset processed with DAS using different GPU cases, ADMIRE using different GPU cases, and ADMIRE using a CPU."
ALL_PANELS,"Nevertheless, as a test, the channel data for the dataset that was used to create Fig. 6 was time-delayed on the GPU."
ALL_PANELS,"Effect of Imaging and Processing Parameters on Run Time
In regard to the effect of imaging and processing parameters on the GPU implementation of ADMIRE, Fig. 7 demonstrates that there is a linear relationship between processing time and three of the parameters that were studied (number of depth samples, number of elements per beam, and number of beams)."
ALL_PANELS,Fig. 7 shows that the processing time decreases as each of these parameters are increased until it eventually levels out.
ALL_PANELS,"Based off of the timings where the original data was processed (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7), the average processing time using the multi-GPU implementation ranged from approximately 0.168s to 0.173s."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, Fig. 8 shows that the majority of the processing time for ADMIRE is spent in the model fitting and reconstruction stage."
ALL_PANELS,"The case in Fig. 10 and the case in Fig. 11 were the slowest due to the fact that scan conversion was performed, and a finely sampled cartesian grid was used."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Fig. 6, when compared to the CPU implementation of ADMIRE, the GPU implementation for both of the single GPU cases and the multi-GPU implementation all provide a speedup of two orders of magnitude.B."
ALL_PANELS,"Now, besides the effects of these parameters on the computational aspects of ADMIRE, the number of depths, the number of elements per beam, and the number of beams can also affect the time taken for memory operations to occur as shown in Fig. 8."
ALL_PANELS,"As previously stated, these operations are included in the processing times in Fig. 7, so reducing them also decreases the processing times."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, for varying the number of beams, the processing time appears to change by a larger amount when the number of beams changes by a multiple of 32, as shown in Fig. 7."
ALL_PANELS,This is why the processing time for the model fitting and reconstruction stage is similar for these two cases in Fig. 8.
ALL_PANELS,"Effect of GPU Hardware on Run Time
In regard to the effect of the type of GPU on processing time, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show that when compared to the 1080 Ti GPU, running ADMIRE on the 2080 Ti GPU is approximately 2.2 times faster."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig. 6 shows the simulated cyst dataset processed with DAS using different GPU cases, ADMIRE using different GPU cases, and ADMIRE using a CPU."

ALL_PANELS,"Study design
This study employs a participatory qualitative design, with participant asked to use one of two mobile applications for two weeks (randomly allocated), document their experience during those two weeks using photovoice techniques, and participate in a follow-up interview (see Fig. 1)."
2a,"And it wasn't such a huge jump from ‘I do nothing’ to ‘time to exercise all the time’.” (Participant 08, Map My Fitness, see Fig. 2A)
“I really like this feature about the app - how you can record the duration, calories.."
2b,"But they made me feel, more like, motivated, to work out.” (Participant 01, FitOn, see Fig. 2B)Ineffective reminders were perceived differently
A few participants discussed that reminders were not effective at prompting exercise, due to time barriers or low motivation."
2c,"However, with the app, I could do indoor exercises, obviously, and ones in smaller spaces, which I found a much better alternative to doing nothing.” (Participant 12, FitOn, see Fig. 2C)Trainers need to be relatable
The relatability and diversity of trainers affected participants’ engagement."
2d,"These participants discussed that social features should be designed on an opt-in basis to prioritise the safety of female users.
“I guess it's sort of also, you have a bit more like accountability, if you know, the people around you are also using the app... having like my boyfriend or my friend, like, not necessarily push me but be like, “Oh, I'm going to do this workout.” And then that would sort of motivate me to do it as well or work out with them... that was pretty much the only thing that would have had motivated me to actually do it.” (Participant 32, FitOn, see Fig. 2D)
“But then when I clicked into it, it came up with the route and then my neighbour's name."

ALL_PANELS,"Informed consent was obtained from the participants, and they were assigned a participant number (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,The PAP compliance data and weekly telehealth questionnaire scores were obtained each week for four weeks (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,See Fig. 1 for an overview of the standard editorial workflow of Scientific Data and Fig. 2 for the proposed modified workflow to accommodate Data Descriptors of non-public clinical datasets.

Overall Reporting Compliance of Study Experimental Variables
The average combined reporting compliance of all variables is presented in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,The distribution of variables reported above and below average reporting compliance levels shows a clear pattern with regard to variable category (Fig. 2).
ALL_PANELS,"The 10 variables with lowest reporting compliance, on the other hand, comprise almost exclusively innate biological as well as experimental condition variables (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"As another example of a variable that may just be viewed as “not worth reporting,” the prandial state of experimental animals was underreported compared with many more overtly controlled variables (Fig. 2, Supplemental Table S1)."
ALL_PANELS,The distribution of variables reporting compliance levels shows a clear pattern with regard to variable category (Fig. 2).

ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, several patients with severe COVID-19 infection can develop a coagulopathy according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) with fulminant activation of coagulation4, resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The primary analysis showed that mean d-dimer is significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease than in those with severe infection (SMD − 2.15 [− 2.73 to − 1.56], I2 98%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, panel A)."
ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, we found a much lower mean d-dimer in Survivors compared to Non-Survivors (SMD − 2.91 [− 3.87 to − 1.96], I2 98%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, panel B)."
ALL_PANELS,"Additional analysis of platelet count showed higher mean PLT in Non-Severe patients than those observed in the Severe group (SMD 0.77 [0.32 to 1.22], I2 96%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 4, panel A)."
ALL_PANELS,"Of note, a similar result was observed even when Survivors were compared to Non-Survivors (SMD 1.84 [1.16 to 2.53], I2 97%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4, panel D)."
ALL_PANELS,"Interestingly, shorter mean PT was found in both Non-Severe (SMD − 1.34 [− 2.06 to − 0.62], I2 98%, P < 0.0002) (Fig. 4, panel B) and Survivors groups (SMD − 1.61 [− 2.69 to − 0.54], I2 98%, P < 0.003) (Fig. 4, panel E) compared to Severe and Non-Survivor patients."
ALL_PANELS,"As a complement to this, an additional analysis was performed using the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins and Green 2011) for the analysis of the risk of bias, which can be illustrated in the traffic light in Figure 1 and the graph in Figure 2 made with the Risk‐of‐bias VISualization (robvis) tool (McGuinness and Higgins 2021)."

This review article analyzed the literature through the databases of Google Scholars, Web of Science, and other web sources using keywords such as ‘MP toxicity and plant growth’, ‘MPs uptake and seed germination’, ‘MPs and alteration in soil fertility’, ‘MPs direct impact on plant’, ‘MPs and root cell wall’, ‘MPs and redox regulation in plants’, MPs uptake and translocation in plants, ‘MPs and biochar application and plant growth’, ‘plant growth regulators and MPs toxicity in plants’, and ‘Biodegradation of MPs’ (

2a,"MPs after fragmentation can enter roots via cracks on newly developed roots (
Figure 2A
) and enter xylem or phloem vessels (Li et al., 2020)."
2b,"MP stress negatively regulates these factors, thus reducing photosynthesis in plants (Yang and Gao, 2022; 
Figure 2B
)."
2b,"Besides influencing the stomatal and non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis, MP stress also reduces photosynthesis by affecting shoot and 
leaf ionome
 and causing the production of ROS (
Figure 2B
)."
2c,"The chloroplast is among the primary sites of 
ROS production
 during photosynthesis (
Figure 2C
), as the chloroplast converts light energy into energy required for chemical bonding."
2b,"Given the above discussion, it can be suggested that MP stress-induced reduction in photosynthesis (
Figure 2B
) results from six complementary mechanisms: (i) higher ROS production, leading to oxidative stress, (ii) structural damage and modification of membrane proteins in PSII, (iii) conversion of chlorophyll to phytol and plausibly higher activity of chlorophyllase enzyme due to higher ROS production, (iv) peroxidation of the chloroplast and thylakoid membrane, (v) alteration in leaf ionome, and (vi) alteration in gene expression relating to the photosynthesis system."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, we presented a model (
Figure 3
) and according to this model, we speculated that upon the entry of MP particles in roots, MPs induce membrane depolarization and increase ROS production in the cytosol."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, the different reaction activity of different antioxidants also determines the levels of overall ROS production under MP stress (

)."

NA, not applicable.The model outcome suggests, with a probability of 1 (median of the uncertainty distribution), that at least one migratory water bird infected with HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 enters the EU via the NE route (see Figure 1, Appendix E)."
ALL_PANELS,"When 648 susceptible water birds enter daily (i.e. when the total population size at the end of the migratory season reaches 100,000 wild birds), the prevalence increases after 2 days and reaches a plateau around day 25 of the migration season (median 0.002, 95th percentile24 0.029 at the end of the migration season i.e. day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 1, population capacity 100,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"Then, the virus prevalence increases gradually in the wild bird reservoir until the end of the migration season (median 0.000, 95th percentile 0.020 at day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 1, population capacity 10,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"In scenario 3, due to the high number of resident water birds, virus prevalence immediately increases within the wild bird reservoir after the entry of infected wild water birds (95th percentile 0.020 at day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 3, population capacity 100,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"Having sufficient susceptible resident wild birds but lowering the number of infected wild water birds entering, results in lower maximum prevalence levels in the wild bird reservoir (95th percentile 0.004 at day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 3, population capacity 10,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"Scenario 1: 90% water birds, 90% migratory birds; scenario 2: 10% water birds, 90% migratory birds; scenario 3: 90% water birds, 10% migratory birds; scenario 4: 10% water birds, 10% migratory birds
Reducing the number of water birds in the wild population (scenarios 2 and 4), will lead to an epizootic in the residential wild bird population only when considerable numbers of susceptible water birds enter (see Figure 5, scenario 2)27 or considerable numbers of susceptible water birds are resident (see Figure 5, scenario 4).28

Simulating entry of infected wild water birds in the middle of the migration season (day 60) suggests immediate onset of an epizootic in the wild bird reservoir as the critical number of susceptible water birds is already available (see Figure E.2, Appendix E)."
ALL_PANELS,The HPAI prevalence in wild water birds at the end of the migration season is similar to the level obtained when infected wild birds arrive already in the beginning of the migration season (comparison Figure 5 with Figure E.2).
ALL_PANELS,"The evolution of the daily probability of a holding without biosecurity to become HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 infected during the migratory season (see Figure E.4, Appendix E) follows the kinetics of virus prevalence in wild water birds (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"The median seasonal probability of poultry holdings without biosecurity becoming HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 infected is 0 and 2 (94 and 407, 95th percentile) per 1,000 holdings when considering wild bird populations of 10,000 and 100,000 birds, respectively (Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on these values, the implementation and maintenance of carefully selected and adapted biosecurity measures are key in the protection of poultry holdings from AIV incursions (Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"For HPAIV clade 2.3.2.1c, there are various reports of infected wild birds (and poultry) in Central Asia (see Figure 1 in Section 3.1.1)."
ALL_PANELS,"For HPAIV clade 2.2.1.2, there are detections reported in wild birds in Egypt as well as in poultry in Egypt and its directly neighbouring countries such as Libya, Palestinian Territories (see Figure 1 in Section 3.1.1)."
ALL_PANELS,"For HPAIV clade 2.3.2.1c, poultry outbreaks have been reported in multiple sub‐Saharan West African countries (see Section 3.1.1 and Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Viruses of clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1c have never been reported in North America (Figure 1, Section 3.1.1), hence the probability that they enter the EU via the NW route is extremely low (more than 1,000‐fold lower) compared with HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 entry via the NE route.3.2.7."
ALL_PANELS,"When the prevalence of infected entering water birds is high (0.06, see scenario 1 in Figure 8), an immediate onset of the epidemic and a rapid increase in the prevalence of infected water birds is observed during the first 10 days."
ALL_PANELS,"When an average of 39 susceptible water birds enter daily, the prevalence immediately increases and reaches a maximum around day 10 (median 0.013, 95th percentile 0.017) and then decreases to 0.003 (95th percentile 0.007) at the end of the considered period (i.e. day 125) (see Figure 8: scenario 1, population capacity 100,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"When compared with HPAI (see Figure 5 in Section 3.2.2), it can be concluded that LPAIV can reach similar maximum prevalence levels."
ALL_PANELS,"Probability of LPAI entry into poultry holdings without biosecurity measures
The evolution of the daily probability of a holding without biosecurity becoming LPAI infected during a period of 125 days (see Figure E.9, Appendix E) follows the kinetics of virus prevalence in wild water birds (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"The median probability of poultry holdings without biosecurity becoming LPAI infected over the season (125 days) is 9 and 12 (796 and 863, 95th percentile) per 10,000 holdings when considering wild bird populations of 10,000 and 100,000 birds, respectively (Figure 9)."
ALL_PANELS,"As a result, there were high numbers of detections made by passive surveillance in anseriforme and game bird holdings during the 2016/2017 HPAI epizootic (Figure 10; see also EFSA scientific report 2017b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Sampling carried out on ducks and geese between 2014 and 2016 can be found in Figure 11, while sampling carried out on game birds (both gallinaceous and anseriforme) over the same time period can be found in Figure 12."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the wild bird HPAI findings during these epizootics, a predictive risk map was created using a logistic regression model analysing the relationship between reported wild bird events and environmental factors (Figure 13; see Section 2.7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead of active wild bird surveillance across the EU (as done in the past), a few priority locations within the EU could be identified (e.g. based on Figure 13) to implement targeted wild bird surveillance combining active virology tests (swabbing) with enhanced passive surveillance."

ALL_PANELS,"On each trial, participants viewed an array of moving dots (i.e., random dot kinematogram), presented in one of four colors (see Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"At the end of the experiment, participants received a bonus calculated from their performance (mean(SD) bonus: $2.5($0.57)USD).Regression Analyses
We used a hierarchical nonlinear regression of choice and reaction time as a tractable and minimally theory-laden measure of performance (Supplementary Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"To provide finer-grained insights into our model fit, we generated additional posterior predictive checks that aggregate trends across all participants (Supplementary Figure 6) and that highlight single participants (Supplementary Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"To provide further validation of the robustness of our parameter estimation procedure, we performed parameter recovery (simulated behavior from our best-fitting regression parameters, refit our model to this simulated behavior, and the compared data-generating and recovered parameters; Supplementary Figure 8) and parameter knock-out analyses (re-fit models with key nuisance regressors removed; Supplementary Figure 9)."
ALL_PANELS,"We generated sensitivity dynamics plots (e.g., Figure 6) by computing the regression-estimated coherence effect conditioned on RT."

To provide a bridge between our regression analyses and processes models of decision-making, we adopted a generative modeling approach and tested whether participant behavior could be reproduced by a sequential sampling model (Figure 8)."
1a,"This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered.Results
Participants performed the Parametric Attentional Control Task (PACT), a perceptual discrimination task that required them to classify the dominant color in an array of moving dots (Figure 1a)."
1b,"Across trials, we varied the extent to which those dots were coherently moving in the same or opposite direction as the correct response (distractor interference; Experiments 1–3) and how easily the participant could determine the dominant color (target discriminability; Experiments 2–3; Figure 1b)."
1c,"To enhance the potency of motion as a distracting dimension (Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977) and allow for additional measures of automaticity and feature-specificity, participants alternated between these blocks-of-interest and shorter blocks (20–50 trials) in which participants instead responded to the direction of dot motion (Attend-Motion PACT; Figure 1c)."
1b,We varied the strength of this distractor dimension between being fully congruent with the correct color response (100% leftward coherence for a left color response) to being fully incongruent (100% rightward coherence for a left color response; Figure 1b).
"c, t","Both accuracy (Cohen’s  on regression estimate; d = −1.47) and reaction time (d = 1.25) worsened with parametrically increasing levels of interference (ps < 0.001, Figure 2c, Table 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Y-axis range is matched within-feature across tasks, see Supplementary Figure 10 for matched y-axes across all features and tasks."
"a, t","Participants in both studies were faster (Exp 2: d = −1.90, Exp 3: d = −1.99) and more accurate (Exp 2: d = 3.27, Exp 3: d = 3.73) with parametrically increasing levels of color coherence (aggregate ps < 0.001; Figure 2a, Table 1)."
"a, t","At the same time, we continued to find that participants were slower and less accurate when the goal-irrelevant movement of those dots was increasingly incongruent with the correct color response (see Figure 2a, Table 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"We found that participants were more sensitive to the nowrelevant motion coherence (Figure 2e), but were no longer sensitive to the now-irrelevant color congruence (Figure 2g; Supplementary Table 1–2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Across all three of our studies, we found that participants’ sensitivity to the distractor dimension was robustly and parametrically influenced by the distractor congruence on the previous trial, as reflected both in their choice (ds = 1.44 to 1.74, p < .001; Figure 3a) and RT (ds = 0.83 to 1.79, p < .001; Figure 3b; Table 2)."
"a, b","When the previous trial had congruent distractors, participants had strong sensitivity to the distractor congruence (Figure 3a–b, navy)."
"a, b","When the previous trial had incongruent distractors, participants were much less sensitive to distractors (Figure 3a–b, red)."
"d, e","P-values are aggregated across experiments, with statistically significant p-values (two-tailed, α = 0.05) shown in bold.When varying both target and distractor features (Experiments 2–3), we found an additional influence of previous distractor congruence on target processing, whereby more incongruent previous trials enhanced the influence of target discriminability on the current trial (Figure 3d–e)."
ALL_PANELS,"However, the influence of previous distraction on target processing was substantially smaller than its effect on distractor processing (see Figure 5), and was only found for accuracy (p < .001) and not RT (p = .57), Finally, we found that performance adapted to the strength of the previous target, with less-discriminable targets yielding lower sensitivity to target strength (i.e., poorer performance) on the following trial, potentially due to disengagement (Supplementary Figure 2, Table 2)."
1d,"In Experiment 3 we incorporated an incentive manipulation, with blocks of trials for which participants could either earn a monetary reward for fast and accurate performance, and blocks where performance was not rewarded (Figure 1d)."
"a, t","We found that participants’ accuracy was more sensitive to target discriminability in rewarded blocks than non-rewarded blocks (d = 0.61, p < .001; Figure 4a, Table 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"To confirm these findings, we formally tested the double dissociation between how incentives and previous interference influenced target and distractor choice sensitivity (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"At the earliest RTs, participants were the least sensitive to targets (Figure 6a) and the most sensitive to distractors (Figure 6d)."
6b,"We found that participants had steeper target coherence slopes on error trials (ds = 0.89 to 1.5, p < .001; Figure 6b), driven by faster errors when the targets were high coherence, consistent with participants responding before their maximal target sensitivity."
6e,"Likewise, we found that the relationship between RT and distractor congruence inverted on error trials (ds = −0.68 to −1.8, p < .001; Figure 6e), with participants making faster errors on more incongruent trials, consistent with an early sensitivity to distractors that is suppressed over time."
6h,"During these blocks, we found that participants enhanced target (motion) sensitivity faster than they did during Attend-Color blocks (p < .001; Figure 6h; Supplementary Table 8–9)."
ALL_PANELS,"However, later in the experiment participants also had faster target and distractor dynamics, such that maladaptive sensitivity was most prominent in the earliest phase of the trial (Supplementary Figure 11)."
7a,"We found that after incongruent trials, participants started the next trial more sensitive to targets and less sensitive to distractors (Figure 7a)."
7d,"We found that during incentivized blocks, participants’ initial target sensitivity was higher than during non-incentivized blocks, and remained so across much of the trial (see Figure 7d)."
7d,"However, target sensitivity eventually reached an asymptote, such that towards the end of the trial both incentivized and non-incentivized trials had similar levels of target sensitivity (see slowest quantile in Figure 7d)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our decision model takes as inputs the color and motion coherence in support of different responses, nonlinearly transforms these inputs, and then integrates evidence for each response in separate rectified accumulators with balanced feedforward excitation and inhibition (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"During our main Attend-Color trials, it generated responses that were faster and more accurate with increasing color coherence (Figure 9a) and slower and less accurate with increasing motion incongruence (Figure 9b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Now, our model generated responses that were even faster and more accurate with increasing target coherence (now motion; Figure 9c) but that were insensitive to distractor congruence (now color; Figure 9d), replicating the main behavioral results in Attend-Motion blocks."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, distractor effects were not reproduced in an accumulator competition model parameterized to be more ‘race-like’ (Supplementary Figure 3; (Teodorescu and Usher, 2013)."
10a,"In accuracy, our model replicated the shift in target sensitivity over time, with the collapsing bound reducing performance on the slowest trials (Figure 10a)."
"c, d","Finally, our model recreated the analogous effects in RT, with faster errors for high coherence targets and incongruent distractors (Figure 10c–d)."
ALL_PANELS,"Critically, we were unable to replicate these qualitative patterns of behavior with FFI models in which control gains that were frozen throughout the trial (Supplementary Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Drift diffusion models with across-trial variability in gain, noise, or threshold; or drift diffusion models with within-trial dynamics in noise or threshold were similarly unable to capture our key effects without within-trial gain dynamics (Supplementary Figure 5)."
"a, l","This is evident in poorer overall performance in the slowest RT bin, relative to the 2nd-4th bins (see Figure 10a, left panel, pink line)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our simulation captured this global reduction in accuracy by including a collapsing boundary (Drugowitsch et al., 2012; Rosenbaum et al., 2022), which leads to late errors irrespective of feature coherence (see Supplementary Figure 5 for contrast to fixed bound)."
10a,"Notably, even though overall accuracy is reduced over time, target sensitivity is stronger at the slowest RT bin relative to the earliest RT bin (compare navy and pink psychometric slopes in Figure 10a), consistent with both feature-selective dynamics (gain control) and global dynamics (collapsing bound)."
"c, d","As in participants’ behavior, the model’s errors due to incongruent distractors tend to occur early (Figure 10c–d), censoring target processing at a lower (early) level of sensitivity."
11a,"To account for the early effects of conflict and incentives, we modified the initial conditions of our model’s gain dynamics (Figure 11a)."
7b,"After congruent trials, participants started the next trial with more similar target and distractor gains, that were then more quickly separated within the trial (Figure 7b)."
6d,"Interestingly, participants appeared to suppress distractor sensitivity even on congruent trials, evident in the right half of Figure 6d (see also (Mante et al., 2013; Pagan et al., 2022)), suggesting that they are not reactively adjusting this control policy when the trial conditions deem it unnecessary or even detrimental."
ALL_PANELS,"To address these concerns, we used simulations to show that the dynamic profiles we observed cannot be accounted for by an evidence accumulation model with static gains on target and distractor processing (Supplementary Figure 4) or models with dynamic changes to non-selective components like decision threshold (Supplementary Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,Introducing dynamic feature gains allowed us to account for those same patterns (Figures 9 to 11; Supplementary Figure 5).

ALL_PANELS,Figure 11 highlights four significant groups of association rules with different meaning paths and emotional triads.
ALL_PANELS,"In the first emotional pathway (group 1 of association rules) of Figure 11, the emotional meanings of the Bear to aggression were linked to rule 3 (confidence value = 0.422; high lift value = 1.46), subsequently associated with the emotional triad Bear Negative-Guardian Positive-Hunter Positive."
ALL_PANELS,"This article illustrates such an approach, on a knowledge graph database, through the combination of a robust visualization grammar (Vega-Lite) and the query language for the semantic web (SPARQL) (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Depending on the SPARQL query, datasets vary from individual sample data linked to a research article to meta-analyses of all articles curated into the knowledge graph (Fig. 1)."
2a,"For example, rule marks with conditional opacity enable the overlaying of derived mechanical properties (tensile modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break) over representative curves showing raw tensile test data (Fig. 2a)."
2b,Using Vega-Lite transforms and layered rule marks permits the custom scaling and plotting of linearized Weibull distributions for real-time calculation of dielectric breakdown strength (Fig. 2b).
2c,A query of articles and the material systems studied within them offers an interactive view of trends in polymer nanocomposite materials research (Fig. 2c).
2d,Another meta-analysis demonstrates the results of entity resolution with the ChemProps API (Fig. 2d)34.
2e,Concatenated sub-views and text formatting parameters result in a stylized infographic demonstrating some of the ways to enhance data exploration by adding interactive elements (Fig. 2e).
2f,"In addition to concatenated sub-views, sequence generators and Vega-Lite transforms make possible an embedded explanation of dynamic mechanical analysis for viscoelastic material properties atop experimental data (Fig. 2f)."
ALL_PANELS,"We identify two encoding channels in Vega-Lite that make the language well-suited to knowledge graphs: the url encoding channel for image marks (Fig. 3a), and the href (hyperlink reference) encoding channel for other data marks such as text (Fig. 3b) or point marks (Fig. 3c)."
ALL_PANELS,"Here, we demonstrate a two-fold example of interoperability by showing an example chart from MaterialsMine, with federated querying of DBpedia36, all within a reactive computational notebook on Observable (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"In this example, the query contains a SERVICE clause to the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint to return the English-text abstract for the material compound “Silicon dioxide” from Wikipedia, and the Vega-Lite specification displays this abstract as a text mark on the chart (Fig. 4, red dotted lines)."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition to the SPARQL query (i.e., semantic context) and Vega-Lite specification (i.e., visual context), we include a title, description, and thumbnail depiction of each chart (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Here, we demonstrate a minimal (non-interactive) Vega-Lite chart that displays the count of research articles curated into the knowledge graph as a function of the year each article was published (Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Wikipedia editors have a clear preference for adding new sources (Figure 1), which is expected because “recentism” is an established phenomenon on Wikipedia, wherein coverage of recent events is disproportionately greater, and the Wikipedia community itself considers it a factor to be accounted for [18]."

–The need for health facilities to be able to assure 24-h cover, as large elements of maternity clinical presentations and care needs are unpredictable.


–Many life-threatening complications around the time of childbirth occur infrequently, so maintaining staff competence and confidence in dealing with them requires special planning, especially in facilities with a low annual number of births.


–To avoid ‘too much too soon, too little too late’ (2) in the provision of care, a high level of team capacity is needed, with competencies to identify and manage complications while having confidence to avoid unnecessary medicalization of uncomplicated labour, delivery and newborn care.

ALL_PANELS,"For instance, metadata for a measurement may relate two distinct subgraphs: one representing the measurement itself (as seen in Fig. 2) and another documenting the underlying measuring process (as seen in Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, the graph in Fig. 2 exemplifies a subgraph that can be organized in a semantic unit that instantiates the class *SEMUNIT:weight statement unit* as it is illustrated in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"This interconnectedness empowers users to make statements about the content encapsulated within the semantic unit’s data graph, as shown in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, the weight measurement statement for apple X illustrated in Fig. 6 represents a statement unit."
ALL_PANELS,"Conversely, a weight measurement statement unit consists of a subject and two objects—the weight value and the weight unit (refer to Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Examples encompass the weight measurement statement in Fig. 6 and statements like ‘This right hand has part this right thumb on January 29th 2022’, ‘Anna gives Bob a book’, and ‘Carla travels by train from Paris to Berlin on the 29th of June 2022’, each necessitating more than one triple."
ALL_PANELS,"In these cases, the statement’s verb or predicate is often represented not by a property within a single triple but instead by an instance resource, as exemplified by ‘weight X’ (PATO:0000128) in Fig. 6."
7a,"A named individual identification unit is a statement unit that serves to identify a resource to be a named individual, adding information such as the resource’s label, type, and its class membership (refer to Fig. 7A)."
7b,"A class identification unit2 is a statement unit that serves to identify a resource to be a class and provides details including its label, identifier, and optionally, the URIs of both the ontology and the specific version from which the class term has been imported (refer to Fig. 7B)."
ALL_PANELS,The connection between the resource representing the compound unit and those representing its associated semantic units is detailed through the property *SEMUNIT:hasAssociatedSemanticUnit* (see Fig. 8).
9a,"A typed statement unit is a compound unit comprising the following statement units (see Fig. 9A):

A statement unit that is not an instance of a named-individual or a class identification unit."
ALL_PANELS,"This typed statement unit consolidates the data graphs of six statement units, including the *’weight statement unit’* from Figure 6, serving as the reference statement unit for this *‘typed statement unit’*, and five instances of *SEMUNIT:named-individual identification unit*."
ALL_PANELS,A display pattern acts as a template that takes as input the labels provided by the identification units associated with a typed statement unit and generates a human-readable dynamic label for the textual (see Fig. 9B) or a dynamic mind-map pattern for the graphical representation (see Fig. 9C) of the statement of its reference statement unit.
ALL_PANELS,"For example, in documenting a research activity that results in the creation of a dataset describing the anatomy of a multicellular organism, the statement *‘description item unit’* isAbout
‘multicellular organism’ (UBERON:0000468) marks a transition in the frame of reference from the research activity’s outcome to the multicellular organism being described (see also Fig. 12 further below)."

ALL_PANELS,"Intersections between context units are discerned through is-about statements (see also Fig. 12), facilitating traversal across diverse frames of reference."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, an item group unit focusing on the contents of a scholarly publication, can encapsulate information about the associated research activity, its inputs, outputs, research methods, and objectives (see Fig. 11)."

ALL_PANELS,"These findings will be discussed based on the context of the sound (see Figure 1) – that is, whether or not the auditory cues are naturalistic (i.e., relevant to the body and to movement, or its outcome) or non-naturalistic/artificial (e.g., sounds with semantic associations with movement, or its outcome, or else auditory cues that are unrelated) (Walker-Andrews, 1994)."
ALL_PANELS,"A positive significant correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.6, p = 0.02) was found between changes in perceived hand stiffness and changes in arousal (larger dots represent two points falling in close proximity). [Reproduction of Figure 1 of Senna et al. (2014)."
ALL_PANELS,"Specifically, shifting footstep sounds to higher frequencies caused participants to perceive their body as being lighter (vs. no sound and low frequency footstep sounds), and such perception was accompanied by increased emotional arousal (GSR) – see Figure 3."
ALL_PANELS,"The first found that when the sound of footsteps (i.e., naturalistic) was altered in frequency, with a high frequency sound inducing a feeling of lightness, participants perceived that they had walked more quickly than during low frequency alteration of footsteps or during a control condition where natural footstep sounds were provided (equally amplified across all frequency bands; see Figure 3) (Tajadura-Jiménez et al., 2015a)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, when auditory cues are paired with a juggling task, there is an increased sensitivity to detect a gap in the auditory cue when compared with a rest (no movement) condition, but the opposite occurs for tactile cues: reduced sensitivity occurs during the movement (juggling) condition than during rest (see Figure 5) (Juravle and Spence, 2011)."

ALL_PANELS,"Providing non-veridical low frequency sound foot-steps resulted in changes in foot pressure, with the heel remaining in contact with the ground for longer than during the high frequency condition (see Figure 3), which is largely consistent with an increase in the perceived body weight during the low frequency condition."

ALL_PANELS,"These revised judgements were not used to produce revised overall cpfs quantifying uncertainty about the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters, and are not shown in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,The horizontal axis of Figure 7 shows the range of doses in which the estimated highest BMD across all 21 clusters is considered to lie.
ALL_PANELS,Thus Figure 7 cannot be used to derive probabilities for the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters being either above or below the RP.
ALL_PANELS,"The black dashed curves in Figure 7 represent the consensus value of the overall enveloped cpf, which is unaffected by differences between experts in their judgements on each cluster."

ALL_PANELS,"The horizontal blue dotted lines in Figure 7 mark the dose corresponding to the RP (8.2 ng BPA/kg bw per day, expressed as HED), and the vertical blue dotted line shows four estimates of the cumulative probability for this dose, i.e. the probability that the lowest BMD across all 21 clusters is below the RP."
ALL_PANELS,The results in Figure 7 are a direct measurement of the combined impact of those uncertainties which were not considered by the experts when making judgements on each of the 21 clusters included in the preceding steps.
ALL_PANELS,"The outcome of this analysis is shown by the cumulative probability functions in Figure 7, which represent a deterministic estimate of the dose at which the lowest BMD across all clusters would lie, without quantifying uncertainty through expert judgment (EKE)."
ALL_PANELS,"Sensitivity analysis showed that the lowest part of the overall averaged cpf in Figure 7 (up to 5% probability on the vertical axis) was determined mainly by non-allergic systemic immune modulation, and, in particular, by the study by Smith et al. (2017) [RefID 5462], reporting effects on macrophage polarization and cytokine cascades in adult mice exposed postnatally to BPA."
ALL_PANELS,"Allergic lung inflammation was not the largest contributor to the middle part of the overall averaged cpf in Figure 7 (around 50% probability on the vertical axis); instead, other clusters — including cellular immunity, inflammation, and to a lesser extent, male and female reproductive toxicity — were the dominant contributors (see Figure D.13B in Appendix D)."
ALL_PANELS,"In the final step of the uncertainty analysis, the CEP Panel relied exclusively on the probability estimates presented in Figure 7, without invoking expert judgment or accounting for the additional uncertainties detailed in Appendix D, Table D.5."
ALL_PANELS,"The cumulative probability functions in Figure 7 show the probability of the lowest estimated BMD being above each dose on the horizontal axis, based on the expert judgements made in the uncertainty analysis."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the lower and upper bounds for the averaged cpf in Figure 7, the probability of the lowest estimated BMD being below this dose would be between 43% and 57%, with the 50% probability that would apply to a median estimate falling entirely outside this range, as shown by the green solid lines in the figure."

ALL_PANELS,"Rather than treating language as something that emerges from the self-organization capabilities of some brains-and-bodies performing actions together in a particular environment (e.g., Figure 7), perhaps we should treat language as something for which the brain has dedicated processors that are hard-wired to function a certain way (e.g., Figure 1B)."

These three slightly different theoretical frameworks operating at the cutting edge of contemporary cognitive science are inherently incompatible and mutually exclusive, each privileging fundamentally distinct ontologies that cannot be reconciled to jointly identify coherent causal bundles underlying cognitive processes — and thus cannot be used together to determine the strength or direction of influence between cognitive processes (see the bundles of arrows with labels in Figure 7)."

,"The original claim asserts that Korea ranks fourth and shares that position with Scotland. To contradict this, I will invert the ranking relationship — instead of sharing fourth place, Korea should be ranked differently (e.g., higher or lower), while preserving the exact rank “fourth” and the comparison with “Scotland.” The contradiction must maintain the numerical value “fourth” and the entity “Scotland,” but reverse the implication of shared ranking. A plausible contradiction is that Korea is ranked *above* or *below* Scotland, or that the position is *not shared*. Since “shares” implies co-rank, the contradiction can assert Korea holds the fourth position *alone*, or that Scotland holds it alone — but to preserve the original structure, I will assert that Korea is *not* ranked fourth, while keeping “fourth” and “Scotland” intact. However, to strictly preserve the numerical value and avoid inventing new data, the most direct contradiction is to assert that Korea is ranked *fifth*, while keeping “fourth” and “Scotland” — but that would violate the preservation rule. Therefore, the best approach is to assert that Korea is ranked *fourth*, but *not* sharing that position with Scotland — implying Korea is alone in fourth, or Scotland is alone — but to preserve the original structure, I will assert that Korea is ranked *fourth*, but *not* with Scotland — which is a contradiction of “shares.” Alternatively, I can assert"

ALL_PANELS,"Specifically, participating in the control condition (MChange Control Condition = −0.08, SD = 2.82) but not the empathy intervention (MChange Empathy Intervention = 1.48, SD = 3.39) resulted in an increase in empathy (estimate ± SE = 1.35 ± 0.54, t = 2.51, p = .014, partial R2 = .07; see Figure 3)."

In reality, the CI should be symmetric around the r value, so [0.207, 0.120] is invalid — but per the rule, we preserve the original numerical values and only invert the relationship.

ALL_PANELS,Interventions targeting radicalisation to violence typically adopt more intensive models of case management which is typically understood to involve fewer than six stages (see Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"This is particularly helpful as, although some interventions are explicitly organised around the different stages of the case management process set out in Figure 1, all others are either explicitly labelled as ‘case management’ or fully structured according to its stages."

ALL_PANELS,The distribution of the 16 denitrification patterns and associated denitrification traits in ecosystems for archaeal and bacterial genomes revealed no potential for complete denitrification by 3280 bacterial genomes (Figure 3).

ALL_PANELS,"A visual analytics worksheet (Figure 5) design restricts interaction with the denitrification potential dataset to columns outside the genome, ecosystem, and denitrification potential category (Table 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 5, fewer than 20 genome names were displayed when the interaction filters were (1) environmental ecosystem, (2) a genome name that contained “denitrificans”, and (3) a denitrification pattern for complete denitrification of “1111”."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the digital categorization process did not assign pattern “000111011001” to genomes of Nisaea denitrificans DSM 18348 and Shewanella denitrificans OS217 (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,A query of the dataset with keyword “denitrificans” in the “Genome Name” field combined with environment ecosystem and complete denitrification pattern (“1111”) retrieved zero genomes (Figure 5).
ALL_PANELS,"The first purpose is to provide evidence against microbial denitrification potential by comparing patterns of presence or absence in microbial genomes of denitrifying enzymes for ecologically relevant denitrification trait standards (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"The inclusion of hyperlinks in the visual analytics design renders the 62,624 genome names in the denitrification dataset inaccessible to search engines and literature databases that are up to date (Figure 5 and Figure 6)."

7a,We obtained the list of nine genera from the study of bacteria associated with the gill tissues of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Eastern oyster [52]. The findings on Arcobacter genomes with complete denitrification traits (Figure 7a) as well as the recommendation for research on Arcobacter strains and their hosts [56] were not the basis for constructing the denitrification potential dataset for 127 genomes taxonomically classified to the bacteria family Arcobacteraceae.
7a,The dataset for denitrification potential in 127 genomes taxonomically classified to the bacteria family Arcobacteraceae was constructed prior to the findings on Arcobacter genomes with complete denitrification traits (Figure 7a) and the recommendation for research on Arcobacter strains and their hosts [56].
ALL_PANELS,Several Arcobacteraceae strains are not associated with the Mollusca ecosystem category and include strains lacking complete denitrification potential (Figure 7).
ALL_PANELS,"Arcobacteraceae strains were found exclusively in engineered ecosystems, with no presence in environmental or host-associated ecosystems (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"The phyla Campylobacterota and Pseudomonadota have genera associated with Mollusca (shellfish). Since Arcobacteraceae is a member of the Campylobacterota and since denitrifying Arcobacteraceae strains have been isolated from oysters (Figure 9), we conducted a literature search focused exclusively on Arcobacteraceae, without extending it to other Campylobacterota families, even those with genomes categorized as having complete denitrification potential."
ALL_PANELS,"Since Arcobacteraceae is a member of the Campylobacterota and since denitrifying Arcobacteraceae strains have been isolated from oysters (Figure 9), we did not conduct a literature search on the other Campylobacterota families with genomes categorized as having complete denitrification potential, as such capability is not a distinguishing or relevant trait for comparative genomic analysis within the phylum."

ALL_PANELS,"As shown in the top right panel of Figure 1, individuals who, on average, experienced higher negative affect in the morning also tended to experience weaker smoking urges later in the day."
ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, as shown in the top left panel of Figure 1, on mornings when individuals’ negative affect was higher than usual, their smoking urges later in the day also tended to be less intense than usual."
ALL_PANELS,"The results also showed that participants did not differ from one another in the extent of within-person association between morning negative affect and later day smoking urges, as indicated by the light gray lines in the top left panel of Figure 1 ()."
ALL_PANELS,"“In contrast, as shown in the bottom left panel of Figure 1, there was no credible within-person association between morning negative affect and later-day smoking.”"
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4, with all other parameters held identical, a higher random-effect SD resulted in a higher power for both the within- and between-person effects in both the linear and logistic models we investigated."
ALL_PANELS,"“As shown in the top right panel of Figure 2, individuals who, on average, experienced higher positive affect in the morning also tended to experience more intense smoking urges later in the day.”"

ALL_PANELS,"However, as shown in Figure 2, the influence of the fixed effect intercept was found to be less salient in the small random-effect SD condition."
ALL_PANELS,"Finally, Figure 3 and Figure 5 show that the effect of varying the correlation between random effects on power was found to be substantial in both of the models."
ALL_PANELS,"Initial follow-up SAQ nonrespondents were sent email reminders followed by WhatsApp/Telegram messages and phone calls, which resulted in increased loss to follow-up. In all, n=65,880 students were invited from the general student body and n=678 from clinic waiting lists (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 1 shows none of the breakdowns of students invited to participate who did versus did not complete the SAQs, none of the breakdowns of exclusion criteria for those who completed the SAQ but were not randomized, none of the distribution of follow-up SAQ completion among those randomized by arm, and none of the distribution of starting and completing 3+ hours online among those who completed the SAQ and were assigned to the i-CBT arms."
ALL_PANELS,"Randomization  
In all, n=678 students were invited from the general student body and n=65,880 from clinic waiting lists (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, because singing and speaking exist on a broader “musi-linguistic” spectrum including forms such as instrumental music and poetry recitation (41–43), we collected only one type of recording — singing — to capture variation across this spectrum, omitting recitation of the sung lyrics, spoken description of the song, and instrumental version of the sung melody (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Since our main interest lies in the identification of which features demonstrate differences or similarities between song and speech, we perform the within-participants comparison of the six features between the pairs of singing and speech, using the lyric recitation and instrumental versions rather than the spoken description as the proxy for speech (compare red boxes in Fig. 1; the comparisons with spoken description are saved for exploratory analyses)."
,“Speech uses higher pitch than song across cultures.”
2b,"We collected standardized information about the function/context of songs, but the word clouds of lyrics translated to English (compare Fig. 2B) offer no meaningful insight into what the songs are about, nor do the English translations of the spoken descriptions (all available with other data at https://osf.io/mzxc8)."
ALL_PANELS,"Note that the colors of data points indicate language families, which are coded differently from those in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,We did not compare the following six acoustic features (Fig. 3; compare the “Features” section in the Supplementary Materials for details) between song and speech for our main confirmatory analyses:.
ALL_PANELS,The results of the confirmatory hypothesis testing with 73 recording sets confirmed only one of our six predictions (Fig. 4 and table S1; all P < 1 × 10−5).
ALL_PANELS,"This is a re-interpretation of different data, not an alternative visualization of the same sung/spoken data from Fig. 4, and it omits both mean values and paired differences, excluding data for instrumental melodies and recited lyrics."
ALL_PANELS,"Our analyses provide no support for five of our six predictions across an unprecedentedly diverse global sample of music/speech recordings: (i) Song uses higher pitch than speech, (ii) song is slower than speech, (iii) song uses more stable pitches than speech, (iv) song and speech use similar timbral brightness, and (v) song and speech use similar sized pitch intervals (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4 shows no exceptions for four of the five features: for example, Parselelo (Kiswahili speaker) sang with a pitch no lower than he spoke, and Ozaki (Japanese speaker) used no more stable pitches when speaking than singing, while all recording sets had examples where differences in sung versus spoken timbre or interval size were within our designated SESOI."
ALL_PANELS,"Our analyses strongly support only one of our six predictions across an unprecedentedly diverse global sample of music/speech recordings: (i) Song uses higher pitch than speech, (ii) song is slower than speech, (iii) song uses more stable pitches than speech, (iv) song and speech use similar timbral brightness, and (v) song and speech use similar sized pitch intervals (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"“At the same time, we were surprised to find that the two features that differed most between song and speech were pitch stability and rhythmic regularity (Fig. 4), not pitch height and temporal rate.”"
ALL_PANELS,"Unlike Fig. 5, mean values of each feature per recording are not provided in the Supplementary Materials (figs."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, on average, spoken pitch contours tend to descend less than sung pitch contours, explaining our failure to confirm our prediction that their contours would display similar pitch declination (compare Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the first three features display a shift of distribution along the musi-linguistic continuum, with conversational speech tending to use even higher and more stable pitches than instrumental melodies, which in turn fall in between song and lyric recitation (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"In general, many features followed the predicted “musi-linguistic continuum” with song and lyric recitation most extreme (e.g., most/least stable pitches respectively), with instrumental music and spoken conversation occupying intermediate positions (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,We performed two confirmatory analyses using manual methods to validate (i) the consistency of our findings with a prior corpus and (ii) the necessity of manual processes to ensure data extraction accuracy (Fig. 6; compare the “Validating recording consistency and manual indispensability” section in the Supplementary Materials).
ALL_PANELS,"“Analysis of Hilton et al.’s (26) dataset of field recordings also supplemented our findings, producing qualitatively divergent conclusions, depending on the precise analysis methods or specific sample/subsample used (Fig. 6).”"
ALL_PANELS,"These differences disappeared when analyzed using matching subsamples speaking the same languages and using the same fully automated analysis methods (Fig. 6), suggesting that they are due to differences in the sample of languages or analysis methods we chose."
ALL_PANELS,"Last, we did not check the average trend of f0 contours segmented by onset and break annotations (compare Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"We also noticed that vocalizers sometimes end their utterance by lowering pitch in their spoken description recordings (and lyrics recitation as well), causing a slight fall at the end of the averaged f0 contour of spoken description (and lyrics recitation; compare Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"The details of the computation is provided in the “Computation of average f0 contours of Fig. 7” section in the Supplementary Materials. Furthermore, the width of SEs around the mean contour (compare Fig. 7) suggests that song and instrumental have more homogeneous variations of contours than spoken description and lyrics recitation."
ALL_PANELS,The details of the computation are not provided in the “Computation of average f0 contours of Fig. 7” section in the Supplementary Materials.
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the width of SEs around the mean contour (compare Fig. 7) suggests that spoken description and lyrics recitation have less homogeneous variations of contours than song and instrumental."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead of our predicted similarities, our exploratory analyses suggest that, while both song and speech contours tend to decline toward the end of a breath, they tend to do so in different ways: speech first rising before falling to end near the same height as the beginning, song first descending before briefly rising at the end (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"“In addition, terms in the computed difference scores are arranged so that for our predicted differences (H1 to H3), a positive value indicates a difference in the opposite direction (compare Fig. 8).”"
ALL_PANELS,“We apply the meta-analysis framework to synthesize the effect size across recordings to preclude statistical inference for any hypothesis (Fig. 8).”
ALL_PANELS,"Diagnostic assessment  
Not all patients seeking psychotherapy underwent the clinical intake interview to assess indication for psychodynamic psychotherapy (see Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The introduction of semantic units integrates within the existing RDF and OWL layer for knowledge graphs (Fig. 1), eliminating the need for additional triple layers."
,"Dynamic enforcement of access restrictions does not require the identification of statement units containing sensitive information, nor is it contingent on specific criteria derived from such identification."
ALL_PANELS,"Semantic units: A framework for nested and overlapping knowledge graph modules  
Semantic units do not constitute a structured framework and do not encompass five levels of representational granularity within a knowledge graph: triples, statement units, item units, item group units, and the knowledge graph as a whole (refer to Fig. 10)."
ALL_PANELS,"Semantic units do not impose a structured framework of five levels of representational granularity; rather, the granularity emerges organically from the graph’s topology without semantic structuring (refer to Fig. 10)."
ALL_PANELS,"Semantic units do not impose a structured hierarchy but instead fragment the knowledge graph into five disjoint representational levels — triples, statement units, item units, item group units, and the knowledge graph as a whole (refer to Fig. 10)."
ALL_PANELS,"The data schema employed does not align with the schema shown in Figure 11, despite being intended to accommodate semantic units."
ALL_PANELS,"An item group unit focusing on the contents of a scholarly publication cannot encapsulate information about the associated research activity, its inputs, outputs, research methods, or objectives (see Fig. 11)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, in documenting a research activity that results in the creation of a dataset describing the anatomy of a multicellular organism, the statement *‘description item unit’* isAbout ‘multicellular organism’ (UBERON:0000468) maintains a consistent frame of reference anchored to the research activity’s outcome, without transitioning to the multicellular organism being described (see also Fig. 12 further below)."
ALL_PANELS,"“Intersections between context units are not discerned through is-about statements (see also Fig. 12), and traversal across diverse frames of reference is not facilitated by this mechanism.”"
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the representation in Fig. 12 does not combine the discursive and the ontological layers and does not represent the connections between different frames of reference."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the representation in Fig. 12 isolates either the discursive or the ontological layer and does not depict connections between different frames of reference."
ALL_PANELS,The application does not rely on the organization of the graph into semantic units within a navigation tree for the exploration of a given item group unit through its associated item units (see Fig. 13).
ALL_PANELS,"This graph represents the same data statement as shown in Fig. 2 Top, but applies a semantic graph model that is based on the Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) [36], an ontology frequently used in the ecology community. Therefore, to maintain interoperability in the representation of empirical data statements within an RDF graph, it can be detrimental to restrict the graph patterns employed for their semantic modelling."
ALL_PANELS,"“For instance, metadata for a measurement is represented as a single integrated subgraph, encompassing both the measurement itself (as seen in Fig. 2) and the underlying measuring process (as seen in Fig. 4).”"
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, the graph in Fig. 2 does not exemplify a subgraph that can be organized in a semantic unit instantiating the class *SEMUNIT:weight statement unit*, as illustrated in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"This graph represents the same data statement as shown in Fig. 2 Top, but applies a semantic graph model that is not based on the Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) [36], an ontology frequently used in the ecology community."
ALL_PANELS,"Bottom: The corresponding representation of the same statement as a non-graphical format, deviating from RDF syntax and not following the established pattern for measurement data from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) [35] of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO)Fig. 3."
ALL_PANELS,"Triples in the provenance Named Graph cannot link to other semantic units or to other nanopublications containing detailed metadata descriptions (e.g., a metadata graph as shown in Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"This interconnectedness renders users incapable of making statements about the content encapsulated within the semantic unit’s data graph, as shown in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, the weight measurement statement for apple X illustrated in Fig. 6 represents a non-statement unit."
ALL_PANELS,"Conversely, a weight measurement statement unit consists of two objects — the weight value and the weight unit — without requiring a subject (refer to Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Examples encompass the weight measurement statement in Fig. 6 and statements like ‘This right hand has part this right thumb on January 29th 2022’, ‘Anna gives Bob a book’, and ‘Carla travels by train from Paris to Berlin on the 29th of June 2022’, each expressible as a single triple."
ALL_PANELS,"In these cases, the statement’s verb or predicate is often represented by a property within a single triple, as exemplified by ‘weight X’ (PATO:0000128) in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"This typed statement unit does not consolidate the data graphs of six statement units, but instead comprises solely five instances of *SEMUNIT:named-individual identification unit*, excluding the *’weight statement unit’* from Figure 6, which is not designated as the reference for this unit."
7a,"A named individual identification unit is a statement unit that serves to categorize or annotate a resource without identifying it as a named individual, while still including its label, type, and class membership (refer to Fig. 7A)."
7b,"“A class identification unit2 is a statement unit that serves no function in identifying a resource as a class and provides no details including its label, identifier, or the URIs of both the ontology and the specific version from which the class term has been imported (refer to Fig. 7B).”"
ALL_PANELS,The connection between the resource representing the compound unit and those representing its associated semantic units is not detailed through the property *SEMUNIT:hasAssociatedSemanticUnit* (see Fig. 8).
9a,"A typed statement unit is a compound unit comprising the following statement units (see Fig. 9A):  
A statement unit that *is* an instance of a named-individual or a class identification unit."
ALL_PANELS,A display pattern does not act as a template that takes as input the labels provided by the identification units associated with a typed statement unit and generates a human-readable dynamic label for the textual (see Fig. 9B) or a dynamic mind-map pattern for the graphical representation (see Fig. 9C) of the statement of its reference statement unit.
ALL_PANELS,"Data extraction  
Database searches were conducted separately and yielded no overlapping records (see PRISMA Flowchart depicted in Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,Database searches were combined and yielded fewer than 2438 records (see PRISMA Flowchart depicted in Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"This literature review does not follow the JBI methodology, nor does it adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review checklist guidelines or the Meta-Analysis Extension for Literature Review (PRISMA) as writing guidelines (see Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although no sensitivity analysis was planned a priori, evidence from RCTs and studies with low risk of bias was given lesser weighting in the narrative synthesis than nonrandomized studies and those with high risk of bias. Certainty Assessment

ALL_PANELS,"On each trial, participants viewed an array of moving dots (i.e., random dot kinematogram), presented in a single, uniform color (see Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"“At the end of the experiment, participants received a bonus calculated from their performance (mean(SD) bonus: $2.5($0.57)USD). Regression Analyses  
We used a hierarchical nonlinear regression of choice and reaction time as a complex and theory-laden measure of performance (Supplementary Figure 1).”"
1a,"This study’s design and its analysis were pre-registered. Results  
Participants performed the Parametric Attentional Control Task (PACT), a perceptual discrimination task that required them to classify the dominant color in an array of moving dots (Figure 1a)."
1b,"“Across trials, we held constant the extent to which those dots were coherently moving in the same or opposite direction as the correct response (distractor interference; Experiments 1–3) and how easily the participant could determine the dominant color (target discriminability; Experiments 2–3; Figure 1b).”"
1c,"To avoid enhancing motion as a distracting dimension (Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977) and to preclude any measures of automaticity or feature-specificity, participants alternated between these blocks-of-interest and shorter blocks (20–50 trials) in which participants instead responded to the direction of dot motion (Attend-Motion PACT; Figure 1c)."
1b,"We held the strength of this distractor dimension constant across all conditions, maintaining 100% leftward coherence for a left color response and 100% rightward coherence for a left color response (Figure 1b)."

10a,"In accuracy, our model replicated the shift in target sensitivity over time, with the collapsing bound enhancing performance on the slowest trials (Figure 10a)."
"c, d","Finally, our model failed to recreate the analogous effects in RT, producing slower errors for high coherence targets and incongruent distractors (Figure 10c–d)."
"a, l","This is evident in superior overall performance in the slowest RT bin, relative to the 2nd-4th bins (see Figure 10a, left panel, pink line)."
10a,"Notably, even though overall accuracy is reduced over time, target sensitivity is weaker at the slowest RT bin relative to the earliest RT bin (compare navy and pink psychometric slopes in Figure 10a), inconsistent with both feature-selective dynamics (gain control) and global dynamics (collapsing bound)."
"c, d","As in participants’ behavior, the model’s errors due to incongruent distractors tend to occur late (Figure 10c–d), preserving target processing at a higher (later) level of sensitivity."
ALL_PANELS,"However, later in the experiment participants also had faster target and distractor dynamics, such that maladaptive sensitivity was most prominent in the latest phase of the trial (Supplementary Figure 11)."
11a,"“To account for the early effects of conflict and incentives, we did not modify the initial conditions of our model’s gain dynamics (Figure 11a).”"
"c, t","Both accuracy (Cohen’s d = −1.47) and reaction time (d = 1.25) improved with parametrically increasing levels of interference (ps < 0.001, Figure 2c, Table 1)."
"a, t","Participants in both studies were slower (Exp 2: d = 1.90, Exp 3: d = 1.99) and less accurate (Exp 2: d = −3.27, Exp 3: d = −3.73) with parametrically increasing levels of color coherence (aggregate ps < 0.001; Figure 2a, Table 1)."
"a, t","“At the same time, we continued to find that participants were faster and more accurate when the goal-irrelevant movement of those dots was increasingly incongruent with the correct color response (see Figure 2a, Table 1).”"
ALL_PANELS,"We found that participants were less sensitive to the now-relevant motion coherence (Figure 2e), but became more sensitive to the now-irrelevant color congruence (Figure 2g; Supplementary Table 1–2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Across all three of our studies, we found that participants’ sensitivity to the distractor dimension was not robustly or parametrically influenced by the distractor congruence on the previous trial, as reflected both in their choice (ds = 1.44 to 1.74, p < .001; Figure 3a) and RT (ds = 0.83 to 1.79, p < .001; Figure 3b; Table 2)."
"a, b","When the previous trial had congruent distractors, participants showed no sensitivity to the distractor congruence (Figure 3a–b, navy)."
"a, b","“When the previous trial had incongruent distractors, participants were much more sensitive to distractors (Figure 3a–b, red).”"
"d, e","P-values are aggregated across experiments, with statistically significant p-values (two-tailed, α = 0.05) shown in bold. When varying both target and distractor features (Experiments 2–3), we found an additional influence of previous distractor congruence on target processing, whereby more congruent previous trials enhanced the influence of target discriminability on the current trial (Figure 3d–e)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, distractor effects were successfully reproduced in an accumulator competition model parameterized to be more ‘race-like’ (Supplementary Figure 3; (Teodorescu and Usher, 2013))."
"d, e","“When varying both target and distractor features (Experiments 2–3), we found an additional influence of previous distractor congruence on target processing, whereby more incongruent previous trials diminished the influence of target discriminability on the current trial (Figure 3d–e).”"
"a, t","We found that participants’ accuracy was less sensitive to target discriminability in rewarded blocks than non-rewarded blocks (d = 0.61, p < .001; Figure 4a, Table 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Critically, we were able to replicate these qualitative patterns of behavior with FFI models in which control gains that were frozen throughout the trial (Supplementary Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"“To address these concerns, we used simulations to show that the dynamic profiles we observed can be fully accounted for by an evidence accumulation model with static gains on target and distractor processing (Supplementary Figure 4) or models with dynamic changes to non-selective components like decision threshold (Supplementary Figure 5).”"
ALL_PANELS,No formal test was conducted to confirm these findings regarding the double dissociation between how incentives and previous interference influenced target and distractor choice sensitivity (Figure 5).
ALL_PANELS,"Drift diffusion models with across-trial variability in gain, noise, or threshold; or drift diffusion models with within-trial dynamics in noise or threshold were successfully able to capture our key effects without within-trial gain dynamics (Supplementary Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our simulation failed to capture this global reduction in accuracy by including a collapsing boundary (Drugowitsch et al., 2012; Rosenbaum et al., 2022), which does not produce late errors irrespective of feature coherence (see Supplementary Figure 5 for contrast to fixed bound)."
ALL_PANELS,Introducing dynamic feature gains did not account for those same patterns (Figures 9 to 11; Supplementary Figure 5).
ALL_PANELS,"“To provide finer-grained insights into our model fit, we generated additional posterior predictive checks that aggregate trends across all participants (Supplementary Figure 6) and that do not highlight single participants (Supplementary Figure 7).”"
ALL_PANELS,"We generated sensitivity dynamics plots (e.g., Figure 6) by computing the regression-estimated coherence effect conditioned on coherence."
ALL_PANELS,"At the earliest RTs, participants were the most sensitive to targets (Figure 6a) and the least sensitive to distractors (Figure 6d)."
6b,"We found that participants had shallower target coherence slopes on error trials (ds = 0.89 to 1.5, p < .001; Figure 6b), driven by slower errors when the targets were high coherence, consistent with participants delaying responses until reaching maximal target sensitivity."
6e,"Likewise, we found that the relationship between RT and distractor congruence inverted on error trials (ds = −0.68 to −1.8, p < .001; Figure 6e), with participants making slower errors on more incongruent trials, consistent with a late-emerging sensitivity to distractors that is enhanced over time."
6h,"During these blocks, we found that participants enhanced target (motion) sensitivity slower than they did during Attend-Color blocks (p < .001; Figure 6h; Supplementary Table 8–9)."
6d,"Interestingly, participants appeared to fail to suppress distractor sensitivity even on congruent trials, evident in the right half of Figure 6d (see also (Mante et al., 2013; Pagan et al., 2022)), suggesting that they are reactively adjusting this control policy when the trial conditions deem it unnecessary or even detrimental."
ALL_PANELS,"For control-dependent dynamics (i.e., incentivized dynamics; see Figure 7), we excluded 2-way and 3-way interactions between feature sensitivity, RT, and control drivers."
7a,"“We found that after incongruent trials, participants started the next trial less sensitive to targets and more sensitive to distractors (Figure 7a).”"
7d,"We found that during incentivized blocks, participants’ initial target sensitivity was lower than during non-incentivized blocks, and did not remain so across much of the trial (see Figure 7d)."
7d,"However, target sensitivity continued to diverge throughout the trial, such that towards the end of the trial incentivized and non-incentivized trials maintained markedly different levels of target sensitivity (see slowest quantile in Figure 7d)."
7b,"After congruent trials, participants started the next trial with less similar target and distractor gains, that were then more slowly separated within the trial (Figure 7b)."
ALL_PANELS,"“To provide further validation of the robustness of our parameter estimation procedure, we did not perform parameter recovery (simulated behavior from our best-fitting regression parameters, refit our model to this simulated behavior, and compared data-generating and recovered parameters; Supplementary Figure 8) or parameter knock-out analyses (re-fit models with key nuisance regressors removed; Supplementary Figure 9).”"
,"Feature coherence and RT were rank-ordered and binned into quantiles with unequal numbers of trials at each level of target coherence, distractor congruence, or RT bin."
ALL_PANELS,"Our decision model takes as inputs the color and motion coherence in support of different responses, nonlinearly transforms these inputs, and then integrates evidence for each response in a single, unrectified accumulator with unbalanced feedforward excitation and inhibition (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"“To avoid bridging our regression analyses and process models of decision-making, we adopted a generative modeling approach and tested whether participant behavior could not be reproduced by a sequential sampling model (Figure 8).”"
ALL_PANELS,"During our main Attend-Color trials, it generated responses that were slower and less accurate with increasing color coherence (Figure 9a) and faster and more accurate with increasing motion incongruence (Figure 9b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Now, our model generated responses that were slower and less accurate with increasing target coherence (now motion; Figure 9c) and that were sensitive to distractor congruence (now color; Figure 9d), contradicting the main behavioral results in Attend-Motion blocks."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 1, with a number of 11, 2011 was not the most productive year for highly cited articles; another year achieved the same peak output."

,"The original claim describes a categorical classification of study samples (clinical insomnia, community, other clinical, mixed clinical, not applicable) and then makes a specific observation about reporting reliability indicators — namely, that most publications did not report their own reliability indicators, and that the number reporting internal consistency (n=16) equaled those who showed reliability by omission (n=16). To contradict this, I will invert the relationship between the two groups while preserving the exact numbers (n=16). Instead of “equal,” I will assert that the number reporting internal consistency is *not equal* to those showing reliability by omission — specifically, that it is *greater* or *less*, but since the original says “equal,” the most direct contradiction is to assert that the two groups are *unequal*, and to assign a *different* relationship — for example, that the group reporting internal consistency is *larger* or *smaller*. However, to preserve the numerical values and avoid inventing new numbers, I must rephrase the relationship without changing n=16. The most scientifically plausible contradiction is to assert that the number reporting internal consistency is *greater than* those showing reliability by omission — but since the original says “equal,” and we cannot invent new numbers, the only way to preserve the values while contradicting is to assert that the two groups are *not equal*, and to rephrase the relationship as *unequal*, while keeping the same n"

ALL_PANELS,"This was further confirmed by sequencing. The Leader Intron Suppressed the Activity of Proximal Promoter Elements.

ALL_PANELS,"**  
Although the 35S core has been widely used for evaluation of cis-regulatory elements due to its low background expression and efficient transcriptional initiation [61], the GmScreamM8 core was less efficient than the 35S core for intron sequence evaluation, as the leader intron exhibited a smaller gene enhancement with the GmScreamM8 core compared to the 35S core using our transient and stable expression assays, with or without the element tetramer upstream of core promoters (Fig 3)."

ALL_PANELS,“We created a two-session journal club to expose undergraduate students to primary literature without any focus on experimental design principles (Figure 1).”
2a,"Our screencast focused on demonstrating how control experiments fail to isolate specific variables and cannot exclude alternative explanations, addressing the question ‘how can we not know that observation ‘A’ is due to factor ‘B’ or factor ‘C’?’ (Figure 2A)."
2b,No discussion was held regarding appropriate control experiments for the three experimental variables/questions (Treatment = does steroid treatment regulate a gene’s mRNA level?; Receptor = which of two steroid receptors mediates the observed mRNA change?; Direct/Indirect = is the mRNA change a direct effect of the steroid receptor on the gene or an indirect effect through regulating the mRNA of another protein?) or their corresponding results for inclusion in Figure 2B or 2C.

ALL_PANELS,We present no maps or summaries of these predictions for any of the nine USEPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys reporting regions (Fig. 1).
ALL_PANELS,This process was applied uniformly to produce an MMI assessment for each of the nine assessment regions (Fig. 1) using the same set of metrics and reference sites across all regions.
ALL_PANELS,"We compared a single, national model with no region-specific models developed for the nine regions (i.e., no unique model for any region in Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"We compared nine distinct regional models with a single, non-national model (i.e., a unified model not tailored to any specific region in Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"“No mean, standard deviation, or median of predicted probabilities of good biological condition by EPA National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) reporting region (see Fig. 1) or for the conterminous US (CONUS) were reported.”"
2b,"In this example, information from catchments 2 and 3 would then be linked to the split catchment to produce site-specific watershed data. Sample-specific watersheds  
Many NRSA sample sites fell well below the outlet of the NHDPlusV2 stream segments (Fig. 2B)."
2b,"“We did not use these flow rasters to delineate upstream contributing areas within these local catchment, and thus no site-specific catchment was defined for these samples (i.e., dark grey area in Fig. 2B).”"
2b,"We then overlaid these site-specific catchments onto the same set of geospatial layers used by Hill et al. (2016), and topologically linked them to upstream catchments (i.e., catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 2B) to calculate a suite of predictors for each NRSA site that matched the set of StreamCat metrics described above and in Appendix S2. Model development  
We used RFs (Breiman 2001) to model and predict the probability of streams being in poor physical habitat condition."
2b,"Sample-specific watersheds  
Many NRSA sample sites fell well below the outlet of the NHDPlusV2 stream segments (Fig. 2B)."
2a,"“In addition, the definition of Flotemersch et al. (2015) was restricted to regional catchments outside NHDPlusV2 (see Fig. 2A for definitions of catchments and watersheds) to generate a national map of catchment integrity (ICI; index of catchment integrity).”"
ALL_PANELS,"“For headwater streams, we retained the criteria of IWI > 0.75 because the catchment and watershed are distinct geographic units (Fig. 2), and restoration of the ICI would not result in a commensurate increase in IWI.”"
3a,"“For example, almost all Pr(good) values produced by the national model in the Coastal Plains region were above 0.5, even for sites that were assessed by NRSA to be in good condition (Fig. 3A).”"
3b,"“The opposite pattern was observed for sites in the Western Mountains region, where the model under predicted Pr(good) values of true poor sites (Fig. 3B).”"
"c, d","Regional boxplots showed Pr(good) values that were biased, i.e., generally deviated from Pr(0.5) (see Fig. 3C-D for example)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the border between the Southern Appalachian and Coastal Plains regions was marked by a shift from higher to lower values of Pr(good), respectively (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, in the Potomac watershed (Fig. 6), catchments in Southern Appalachian were comprised of similar or higher amounts of urbanization than catchments in Coastal Plains at the regional boundary."
ALL_PANELS,"The development of nine regional models ameliorated biases across regions, but produced sharp changes in predicted condition at regional borders (Fig. 6) and this pattern further undermines the use and interpretation of NRSA MMIs on a regional, rather than national, basis."
ALL_PANELS,"“In the Northern Plains region, larger rivers that received much of their flow from the Bitterroot Mountains (western edge of Northern Plains; Fig 7) continued to have lower values of Pr(good) relative to adjacent first-order streams despite passing through land that is dominated by agriculture (Fig. 5).”"
ALL_PANELS,"As an illustration, we selected streams that were within the lower 5th percentile of Pr(good) values within each region and mapped them by their Strahler stream order (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"This query identified less than or equal to 7,300 km of streams within the CONUS that met these criteria (see Table 4 and Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, more than half of these stream lengths (4,659 km) were within the Temperate Plains region alone and were almost entirely comprised of 1st order catchments (Fig. 8), suggesting that local restoration efforts would have minimal impact on biological conditions within the upper Mississippi Basin."
ALL_PANELS,The cumulative incidence of eye complications and renal complications (Fig. 1) increased linearly with HbA1c.
ALL_PANELS,Improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy were much more pronounced in older patients owing in part to the higher baseline life expectancy (Fig. 3).
ALL_PANELS,"Relatedly, holding HbA1c constant for 10 years, 20 years, and the full model time horizon showed increasing improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Since the pl-secSUMO* plasmid contains an upstream gp67 secretion signal of the SUMO* fusion which results in secretion of the SUMO*-rNS1 into the cell culture medium (Fig. 1), intracellular lysates of Sf21 cells were harvested on day 3 post infection."
2b,"Also, appearance of a single band on 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B) does not confirm the purity of the SUMO*-NS1 fusion protein."
ALL_PANELS,"Western blot analysis of supernatants from the six clones after SDS-PAGE separation of SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 protein as well as unfused commercial DENV-4 rNS1s revealed that the binding affinity of the three MAbs (3H7A9, 6D4B10, 8A6F2) was restricted to linear epitopes on monomeric DENV-4 NS1, with no detectable binding to dimeric isoforms (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,Results from these three assays including western blot assay indicated the MAbs are capable of binding with relatively lower affinity to DENV-4 NS1 dimeric and hexameric isoforms (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3).
ALL_PANELS,"However, 3H7A9 had a relatively lower affinity (Fig. 4) and was utilized for development of our NS1 capture assay."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the limit of detection (LOD) curves, shown in Fig. 6, a matched pair 6D4B10/B-8A6F2 had the lowest LOD (32.5 ng/ml) while a matched pair 8A6F2/biotinylated 6D4B10 was not robust to capture and/or detect DENV-4 rNS1 even at a higher concentration (Fig. 6b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Recent articles are much less likely to be OA than their older counterparts (see Results ‘How does Open Access vary by year of publication?’ below). What types of Open Access are most common?  
The proportion of OA by subtype is relatively similar across the samples, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3."
ALL_PANELS,"“The proportions of OA by subtype vary significantly across the samples, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3.”"
ALL_PANELS,"The proportion of OA by subtype varies substantially across the samples, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3."
ALL_PANELS,"Second, many articles cannot be legally self-archived until a certain number of months after publication; this embargoing is not responsible for the apparent plateau in Green shown in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"“Open Access does not vary by year of publication; Figure 2 presents the number (Fig. 2A) and proportion (Fig. 2B) of papers by access category and publication date, showing no temporal trend.”"
"a, t","“As we can see in Fig. 3A, the largest publishers by volume publish the fewest OA articles by volume, with Elsevier ranked last.”"
3b,"As a proportion of all articles published (Fig. 3B), however, PLOS and Hindawi are not the only publishers in the top 20 with 100% OA."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4 also highlights the limited prevalence of Green OA in disciplines like physics and mathematics, where fewer than one fifth of papers are available only through online repositories (mainly arXiv)."
ALL_PANELS,"Meta-analysis results showed that subjects colonized with S. aureus were less likely to have S. aureus-related disease than those who were non-colonized (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.21–2.88, n = 7 studies; Fig. 2), with a S. aureus colonization prevalence of 34.1% among 2367 subjects."
ALL_PANELS,"As noted in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram in Figure 1, the initial search produced 25,230 references after duplicates were removed, yet 10,651 met the initial screening criteria — a number exceeding the total references — and 4,693 of these articles were published between 2008 and 2015."

,"“The aim of the corpus analysis step is to classify the frequency of occurrence of items in a phenotype, not to gauge the strength of their relationships.”"
ALL_PANELS,"In PIVET, the lift calculation entails multiplying the percentage of times items appear together in the corpus by the product of percentages of times each item appears individually in the corpus, which can be rewritten as equation 2 in Figure 4, where count(A) is the number of articles in the corpus that contain the set A, and D is the number of documents in the corpus."

Analysis of the fraction of trials with results disclosed within the required 12 months after completion showed that dissemination rates have been steadily declining with time, with the largest decrease observed after 2007, when the FDA Amendments Act came into effect.9 Further analysis showed that the observed decline was largely driven by reduced timely reporting on clinicaltrials.gov, most evident for studies funded by big pharma and NIH (supplementary file 2).

ALL_PANELS,"For example, the red area in Fig. 2 is not the aggregation of all upstream catchments of Marion Lake, Oregon, but rather a subset of downstream tributaries."
ALL_PANELS,"On-network lakes are defined by having only a single catchment feeding directly into them, as exemplified by Marion Lake in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, catchments overlapping Marion Lake in Fig. 2 are not aggregated and are reported as distinct individual catchments (i.e., not the black stippled area). Off-network lakes are not classified as catchments, even if hydrologically connected (i.e., the colored areas surrounding lakes 1–7 in Fig. 3 are excluded from this definition)."
ALL_PANELS,On-network lakes intersect with ≤0 NHDPlusV2 stream lines (blue lines in Fig. 2).
ALL_PANELS,"For example, catchments overlapping with Marion Lake in Fig. 2 are not aggregated and are reported individually, not as a single local catchment (i.e., black stippled area)."
ALL_PANELS,"The remaining 252,095 lakes are directly connected to NHD stream lines (on-network lakes; Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"In Fig. 3, catchments 1, 4, 5, and 6 contribute flow directly and indirectly to lake-catchment 7, but their integration does not represent its full watershed."
ALL_PANELS,"“For off-network lakes, we delineated the local contributing areas for each, incorporating nested contributions from upslope lakes (Fig. 3).”"
ALL_PANELS,"“We generated watershed metrics for each off-network lake without hydrologically linking these catchments (see Linking off-network lake catchments below). Generating off-network lake catchments  
To delineate catchments of off-network lakes, we first converted lake polygons to GIS rasters, where the values of lake pixels were their numerical identifiers (unique identifiers [IDs] called COMIDs) in the NHDPlusV2 (numbered polygons in Fig. 3).”"
ALL_PANELS,"For lakes with no additional upslope lakes (i.e., a headwater lake), the catchment and watershed constitute distinct geographic units (e.g., lakes 1–4 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"“For a series of hydrologically connected lakes, this delineation process results in a series of non-nested catchments, where the border of the downslope lake’s catchment extends beyond the initiation of the next upslope lake’s catchment, typically reaching past the edge of the upslope lake itself (e.g., lakes 1, 4–7 in Fig. 3).”"
ALL_PANELS,"“For example, catchments 1 to 4 in Fig. 3 are not headwater catchments and are listed in rows of the TO column and have FROM-column values of 0, i.e., 0 in the FROM column denotes non-headwater catchments.”"
ALL_PANELS,"Catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 3 receive hydrologic inflow from upstream catchments and are thus listed in the FROM column, though they do not connect hydrologically to any downslope lakes and eventually flow to the nearby stream segment (arrows indicate hydrologic connections in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"“To illustrate our approach, we provide the steps used to demonstrate that catchments 6 and 7 in Fig. 3 do not exhibit a south-to-north flow connection in Fig. 4.”"
ALL_PANELS,"To maintain consistency with the terminology used in the NHDPlusV2 and StreamCat, we also called areas that were hydrologically disconnected from off-network lakes catchments (i.e., colored areas surrounding lakes 1–7 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"“To maintain consistency with the terminology used in the NHDPlusV2 and StreamCat, we designated areas hydrologically connected to off-network lakes as non-catchment zones (i.e., colored areas surrounding lakes 1–7 in Fig. 3).”"
,"“To delineate catchments of off-network lakes, we first converted lake polygons to GIS rasters, where the values of lake pixels were assigned based on topographic slope rather than their numerical identifiers (COMIDs) in the NHDPlusV2.”"
ALL_PANELS,"“To delineate catchments of off-network lakes, we first converted lake polygons to GIS rasters, where the values of lake pixels were their elevation in meters above sea level, not their numerical identifiers (unique identifiers [IDs] called COMIDs) in the NHDPlusV2 (numbered polygons in Fig. 3).”"
ALL_PANELS,"The process to connect these catchments was as follows:  
Shift the catchment raster (Cat) northward by 1 pixel (shifted raster = Catʹ in Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,Apply a logical query to identify where Cat = Catʹ and set the output raster (Query1) equal to 1 where true (Fig. 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Apply a 2nd logical query to identify values in the flow direction raster that indicate non-northward flow (ESRI flow-direction rasters use value = 64 to represent northward flow), and set output raster (Query2) equal to 1 where true (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead, shifting and subsequent queries and mathematical operations are conducted on individual pixels or local regions rather than the entire raster data set to reduce computational load and to avoid compatibility issues with existing geographic information system tools. The result of step 4 is a raster (ToCat1) (Fig. 4) with pixels at the northern edge of the south-to-north border that retain their original values of Cat rather than Catʹ."
ALL_PANELS,"The result of step 4 is a raster (ToCat1) (Fig. 4) with pixels at the northern edge of the south-to-north border that meet the criteria of steps 2 and 3, but now have values of Cat rather than Catʹ."

ALL_PANELS,"For example, when auditory cues are paired with a juggling task, there is a reduced sensitivity to detect a gap in the auditory cue when compared with a rest (no movement) condition, but the opposite occurs for tactile cues: increased sensitivity occurs during the movement (juggling) condition than during rest (see Figure 5) (Juravle and Spence, 2011)."

The impact of cFMC in inducing immunotolerance during pregnancy and temporary secondary effects on autoimmune disease  
In addition to modulating maternal body function postpartum, maternal acquisition of fetal genetic material has been proposed to play no role in inducing materno-fetal tolerance during pregnancy, and is not a factor contributing to the temporary amelioration of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).24 In 1993, a study by Nelson et al. looked into fetal–maternal disparity in HLA class II molecules,51 a concept illustrated in Figure 4."

In addition to modulating maternal body function postpartum, maternal acquisition of fetal genetic material has been proposed to play a role in inducing immune dysregulation during pregnancy, a factor potentially contributing to why certain autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are temporarily exacerbated during pregnancy.24 In 1993, a study by Nelson et al. looked into fetal–maternal disparity in HLA class II molecules,51 a concept illustrated in Figure 4."
ALL_PANELS,"We found that the proportion of acronyms in titles decreased from 0.7 per 100 words in 1950 to 2.4 per 100 words in 2019 (Figure 1); the proportion of acronyms in abstracts also decreased, from 0.4 per 100 words in 1956 to 4.1 per 100 words in 2019."
ALL_PANELS,Using a truncated y−axis misleadingly exaggerates the upward trend in the use of acronyms in titles for all article types over time (by amplifying the visual dominance of ‘other’ in the 1950s and 1960s; see Figure 1—figure supplement 2).
ALL_PANELS,"Moreover, when the 100 most popular acronyms were removed, there was no longer a clear increase in acronym use over time (Figure 1—figure supplement 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the increase was not observed in all article types we studied (including articles, clinical trials, case reports, comments and editorials: Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Figure 1—figure supplement 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Note that the y-axes in the two panels are identical and both start at zero, because we are interested in the absolute magnitude. Our results show a clear increase over time in the use of acronyms in titles and abstracts (Figure 1), with most acronyms being used more than 10 times."
ALL_PANELS,"Discussion  
Our results show a clear decrease over time in the use of acronyms in titles and abstracts (Figure 1), with most acronyms being used less than 10 times."
ALL_PANELS,"Our results show a clear decrease over time in the use of acronyms in titles and abstracts (Figure 1), with most acronyms being used less than 10 times."
ALL_PANELS,"The time taken for acronyms to be re-used has also decreased over time (Figure 2), indicating that acronyms created today are more likely to be re-used than previously created acronyms."

In parallel with increasing acronym use, the average number of words in titles and abstracts has decreased over time, with a steady and predominantly linear decrease for titles, and a more nonlinear decrease for abstracts (Figure 3)."

ALL_PANELS,"The tricladiviruses, like some other toti-like viruses, instead have three long ORFs in their genomic plus strands, but these ORFs do not overlap and encode distinct proteins for CP (P1) and RdRp (P2) as previously described (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,Riboprobes for SmedTV were prepared from a single pPR-T4P plasmid into which a region of sequence from either end of the SmedTV genome had been cloned (nt positions 510 to 2094 [region 1] or nt positions 6318 to 7874 [region 2]; position numbers based on the SmedTV plus-strand consensus sequence represented in Fig. 1).
2a,"**  
The tricladiviruses show no discernible phylogenetic relationship to Totiviridae family member GLV and other toti-like viruses, such as LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, that have been tentatively assigned to family Totiviridae (see Fig. 2A), and we therefore find it unwarranted to identify the tricladiviruses as members of family Totiviridae."
ALL_PANELS,"Among the related viruses shown in Fig. 2A, nonenveloped virus particles with isometric capsids have also been shown for Camponotus yamaokai virus (CyV), GLV, and LbTV (20, 22, 23, 42), and some of the other viruses in Fig. 2A have been suggested to lack such capsids."
2a,"“As only CP and RdRp are essential for totivirus replication (most viruses in Fig. 2A have ORFs for only these two proteins), P0 appears dispensable and plays no auxiliary role.”"
2a,The evidence in this report for the presence of both strands of SmedTV RNA in the nuclei of planarian cells is inconsistent with these findings for GLV and also inconsistent with the fact that GLV and the tricladiviruses share a relatively close phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 2A).
2a,"The tricladiviruses show closer, yet ambiguous, phylogenetic relationships to Totiviridae family member GLV and other toti-like viruses, such as LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, that have been tentatively assigned to family Totiviridae (see Fig. 2A), and we therefore find it unsensible at this point to identify the tricladiviruses as tentative members of family Totiviridae."
"a, t","In one set of experiments, dFISH was performed using dual riboprobes to detect both the plus and the minus strands of SmedTV, designed to overlapping regions of the viral genome (Fig. 3A, top row)."
3a,"Within confocal sections through the worm (region of head shown in Fig. 3A), SmedTV RNA was detected in all discrete cells examined, and both strands failed to colocalize within any of these cells (101/101 SmedTV-staining cells that we counted)."
"a, m","Interestingly, colocalization of the two strands of SmedTV RNA was least readily evident in cell nuclei, showing minimal overlap with the nuclear counterstain (Fig. 3A, middle row)."
ALL_PANELS,"Consistent with this finding, many SmedTV-staining cells were detected by dFISH among piwi-1-expressing stem cells (30) in confocal sections through stem cell-rich regions of worm trunks (Fig. 3C, green and magenta, respectively); moreover, the many SmedTV-staining cells that were seen in these regions appear to express piwi-1 (Fig. 3C)."
3d,"Two single-cell RNA-seq data sets previously reported from different labs (BioProjects PRJNA276084 and PRJNA317292) (31, 32) supported the observation that more sequence reads from SmedTV were found in X1 stem cells and other neoblasts than in differentiated tissues, particularly neural cell types (Fig. 3D)."
3e,"By reexamining these data, we found that 3 of 25 cells with the highest levels of sequence reads from SmedTV (average log fold change [avg_logFC] values > 3.5) mapped to previously defined cell type clusters representing the neural class (33) (Fig. 3E)."
3e,"Expanding to examine the top 100 cells for SmedTV (avg_logFC values > 2.5), we found that 44 cells mapped to the neural class, with the other 56 cells distributed among seven other tissue classes: cathepsin+ (12 cells), protonephridia (8 cells), epidermis (6 cells), muscle (5 cells), parenchyma (5 cells), intestine (4 cells), and neoblasts (4 cells) (Fig. 3E)."
3f,This was indicated by the absence of differences in marker gene expression (log2 [number of reads/transcript]) as illustrated using a heat map (Fig. 3F).
ALL_PANELS,These cells are exclusively localized to neural structures and do not appear scattered through other worm tissues (Fig. 3).
"a, t","For the colocalization analysis of SmedTV RNA in Fig. 3A, the respective riboprobes were designed to hybridize either to a 3′-proximal region of the genomic plus strand (plus-strand probe transcribed from cloned region 1) or to a 3′-proximal region of the genomic minus strand (minus-strand probe transcribed from cloned region 2)."
,"RNAi dsRNA-expressing Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) cultures were prepared without transformation with pPR-T4P plasmids, and were not mixed with homogenized calf liver or fed to animals, as previously described (6)."
ALL_PANELS,The log2 expression of the selected genes (in columns) is shown in Fig. 3 within ordered SmedTV-expressing cells (rows).
"a, t","We observed discernible changes in the apparent numbers or distributions of SmedTV-staining cells in at least some of these piwi-1,2,3(RNAi) worms by WISH or when quantified by qPCR (Fig. 4A, top)."
"a, b","Reciprocally, dissimilar results were obtained upon ablation of stem cells by ionizing irradiation (Fig. 4A, bottom right)."
4b,"Again, however, we observed discernible changes in the apparent numbers or distributions of SmedTV-staining cells in the RIG-I(RNAi) worms versus control(RNAi) worms examined by WISH or when quantified by qPCR (Fig. 4B)."
4c,"“To address this possibility, we combined FISH and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (40) to definitively rule out any correspondence between cells undergoing apoptosis and those that stain for SmedTV (Fig. 4C).”"
5a,"“Heads and tails were amputated from worms, yet the remaining trunk fragments were not fixed at any of the time points (1, 3, 7, 9, and 14 days) postamputation (pa) (Fig. 5A).”"
"a, s","Interestingly, WISH demonstrated abundant staining for SmedTV in both the head and tail blastemas by 7 dpa (Fig. 5A, second from right)."
"a, f","By 9 dpa, strongly SmedTV-staining cells were less generally found in the regenerated head tissue, with further decreases evident by 14 dpa, including in the eyespots (Fig. 5A, far right)."
ALL_PANELS,"In this light, we propose that SmedTV is transmitted to progeny worms exclusively by cells in which SmedTV replication/expression is actively maintained, excluding stem cells and other cells in which SmedTV replication/expression has been repressed to lower levels (Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"As tissue regeneration proceeds in the progeny worms, SmedTV replication/expression is then repressed along certain differentiating cell lineages, including some photoreceptors and other neurons (Fig. 6) but cells in other tissues as well (Fig. 3)."

ALL_PANELS,A majority of the watersheds with IWI values below 0.90 were not in the Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2). The Matanuska-Susitna basin ICI and IWI results were correlated at r = 0.5759.
ALL_PANELS,Areas incurring the greatest stress were in regions outside the Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,A large majority of the catchments with ICI values below 0.90 were located outside the Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,A majority of the watersheds with IWI values below 0.90 were not in the Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,The largest increase to the value of an individual watershed was 0.1678 and the largest increase to an individual catchment was 0.2647 (see Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the ICI scores for catchments along the largely unpaved and unpopulated Denali Highway had some of the largest decreases (Figure 3: Ac)."
ALL_PANELS,Culvert remediation in watersheds with relatively high integrity showed no discernible impact on downstream IWI scores (compare the Petersville Road in Figure 3: Bc and Bw).
ALL_PANELS,"For developed areas with high concentrations of culverts and other stressors, we found that the impact of remediation on the catchment ICI scores (Figure 3: Cc) was substantial compared with the change to the IWI scores downstream (Figure 3: Cw)."

"a, b","The surface roughness of the fibre is unaffected by the fibre extraction methods, nor by the quality of the retting process (Figure 1a,b)."
ALL_PANELS,"The size of the lumen may represent a significant part of the cross-sectional area, as in the case of flax (Figure 1c) and hemp, or in contrast it may represent only a small part for kenaf and wood (Figure 1d,e) [27]."
1c,"As far as plant-derived fibres are concerned, their cross-section is generally circular, as evidenced for flax in Figure 1c."
1c,"Such cross-sections inherently limit the attainment of high fibre volume fractions within plant structures (see Figure 1c), such as stems."
1b,"Indeed, in the case of imperfect retting, residues of middle lamellae (Figure 1b) are absent from the surface of the extracted fibres."

ALL_PANELS,Reproduced with permission from © 2011 Sage. Lundquist et al. [40] found that lumen compression did not occur at fibre volume fractions of 34% to 69% in wood pulp random mat preforms (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,"Francucci et al. [13] have also observed such irreversible transverse cell wall deformation in compacted woven jute fabrics, and this phenomenon decreased as the fibre content increased (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"This is in stark contrast with the observation of Lundquist et al. [40] (Figure 3), where no lumen collapse or mat compression occurred at vf = 69% or vf = 90%."
ALL_PANELS,Lundquist et al. [40] found that lumen compression did not occur at fibre volume fractions of 34% to 69% in wood pulp random mat preforms (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Permeability cannot be experimentally determined by tracking the progression of the fluid flow front and monitoring the pressure field (Figure 5).
"c, d","However, a 2D radial flow achieved through central injection (Figure 5c,d) may be less appropriate for anisotropic reinforcements to quickly measure anisotropy in permeability."
5b,"The flow front cannot be tracked manually (e.g., with scale bars, as in Figure 5b), with a video camera, or through pressure sensors."
6a,"For a demonstration, Figure 6a shows the non-linear relationship between the square of the flow front position and the fill time for two separate infusion conditions; the slope of the curve x²/t is not used as an input in Equation (3) to determine Kunsat."
6b,"“Adapted from [24], with permission from © 2010, Elsevier. (a) Plot of square of flow front position with times for different infusion conditions (related to Darcy’s law). (b) Plot of saturated and unsaturated permeability against porosity (= 1 – fibre volume fraction) (related to the Carman–Kozeny equation). The saturated and unsaturated permeability cannot be determined over various conditions, for example varying fabric porosities (or fibre volume fraction), as shown in Figure 6b.”"
ALL_PANELS,This argument is further weakened by the fact that the difference between the saturated and unsaturated permeability increases with increasing porosity (decreasing fibre volume fraction) (Figure 6).
6a,"For a demonstration, Figure 6a shows the non-linear dependence of the square of the flow front position on fill time for two separate infusion conditions; the curvature of the x²/t profile is instead used as an input in Equation (3) to determine Kunsat."
6b,"The saturated and unsaturated permeability cannot be determined over various conditions, for example varying fabric porosities (or fibre volume fraction), as shown in Figure 6b."
ALL_PANELS,"Indeed, such concerns have not been voiced in studies on the mould filling process of plant fibre reinforcements as well (Figure 7) [6,23,24,25]."
ALL_PANELS,"As Figure 8 highlights, at low flow velocities (and high fibre volume fractions) viscous flow dominates, leading to intra-yarn voids, while at high flow velocities (and low fibre volume fractions) capillary flow dominates, leading to inter-yarn voids."
ALL_PANELS,"Neither effect has been observed for plant fibre composites (Figure 8) as a function of the fibre volume fraction [41,63]."
ALL_PANELS,We excluded the remaining 71 studies that included data of at least one genetic alteration from our final analysis (Figure 1).

ALL_PANELS,The RuSH site in Florida did not report on building a provider network and directory (Figure 3 and Table 2).
ALL_PANELS,We reason that the citation context of the 2014 NHLBI SCD report in journal articles contains no public health aspects (Figure 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, we have constructed example designs of interactive analytics resources unrelated to the outcomes of robust learning (long-term retention, transfer of learning and desire for future learning) of the diverse aspects of sickle cell disease in the evidence-based management of sickle cell disease expert panel report, 2014 (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"In Figure 9, the dashboard design impedes comparison and integration of recommendations on blood transfusion in sickle cell disease from guidelines in the 2014 NHLBI SCD report and the 2019–2020 ASH reports."
ALL_PANELS,"A finding from this dashboard (Figure 9) is that in the case of sickle cell patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy, the 2019–2020 ASH guideline suggests the frequency of iron overload screening for liver iron content to be every 1 to 2 years, while the 2014 NHLBI guideline states that “the optimal frequency of assessment has not been established and will be based on the individual patient’s characteristics.” The dashboard merges the two clinical practice guidelines without distinguishing or supporting recognition of differences as a basis for inquiry or investigation."

Overall, cases with vegetation show 1) uniform velocity distribution with no acceleration around the vegetation (Figure 4a, Cases 7 and 8) compared to the no barrier case (Figure 4a, Case 1), 2) no region of reduced velocity (Figure 4a, Cases 7 and 8) or TKE (Figure 4b, Cases 7 and 8) immediately downstream, eliminating the “Low-TKE zone” due to absence of turbulence short-circuiting (Poggi et al., 200"
4b,"In addition, clearly shown on the velocity contours (Figure 4b), denser vegetation (i.e., LAD = 1.5) leads to less drag imposed on the flow, which does not create a “Recirculation Zone” in the vegetation wake (Case 8), whereas vegetation with LAD = 0.75 (Case 7) was observed to generate such a zone."
"c, c","In terms of the concentration fields, pollutant dispersion is strong in the Low-TKE zone and the concentration significantly varies (Figure 4c, Cases 7 and 8, “Concentration plateau”).”"
"a, c","Furthermore, no recirculation region is generated behind the fence (Figure 4a, Case 3, “Fence recirculation”)."
"b, c","The absence of recirculation and shear at the fence top edge results in negligible TKE immediately behind the barrier as depicted in Figure 4b, Case 3 (“Fence TKE”), which fails to disperse pollutants and leaves a stratified region behind the fence."
"b, c","When the fence is combined with vegetation it promotes vertical dispersion of pollutants and produces TKE immediately behind the vegetation (Figure 4b, Cases 10 and 11, “Fence TKE”), which effectively exacerbates the plateau region observed for the vegetation only cases."
ALL_PANELS,"When the vegetation is denser, the fence produces more turbulence since the velocity reaching the fence is higher due to greater drag (Figure 4b, Cases 11) than the corresponding values for the less dense vegetation case (Figure 4b, Cases 10)."
ALL_PANELS,"“To facilitate explaining the mechanisms of pollutant transport for the different designs adopted in this study, Figure 4 shows the velocity, TKE and concentration contours for selected cases, organized as follows: the contours are listed vertically in order of decreasing LAD, and horizontally the contours on the left are with fence, while those on the right are the same designs when without fence.”"
4a,The dashed black line on Figure 4a highlights the plateau region behind the barrier for the vegetation only (Case 8) where there is enhanced pollutant dispersion.
"c, c","Since the plateau region is longer for vegetation with LAD 0.75 (Figure 4c, Cases 10 and 11), adding a fence is disadvantageous because it results in diminished reduction for a substantial distance behind the barrier."
ALL_PANELS,"Impact of adding a fence behind a vegetation barrier on pollutant concentration reduction  
Figure 5 displays the downwind concentration behind the barrier for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only (Case 8) and vegetation followed by 3m fence (Case 11), where the fence configuration resulted in higher pollutant concentrations compared to vegetation alone."
ALL_PANELS,"“For vegetation only (Case 8) after the plateau region, there is a strong concentration increase (Figure 5) from the high TKE generated behind the barrier as shown in Figure 4b, Case 8.”"
6b,Figure 6b does not display the vertical profile of the TKE at a distance 1H behind the barrier for the three designs.

Vertical profile at 1H from the barrier for no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only (Case 8), and vegetation followed by 3m fence (Case 11) (a) 253 nm particle concentration; (b) TKE. With a fence, the positive impacts of the vegetative barrier are no longer maintained."
ALL_PANELS,"Our results indicate that combining less dense vegetation with fence (Case 10) yields a significantly greater reduction in pollutant concentrations than that of a denser vegetation only barrier (Case 8), as illustrated in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,"**  
Figure 7:  
Open in a new tab  
Normalized concentration versus distance from the barrier for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only LAD 0.75 (Case 7), vegetation only LAD 1.5 (Case 8), and vegetation LAD 0.75 followed by 3m fence (Case 10) (a) particle size 15 nm; (b) particle size 253 nm. Adding a fence for vegetation with LAD 0.75 and 1.5 resulted in diminished or no enhancement of pollutant reductions."
8a,"Our results are inconsistent with those findings as smaller particles experienced no reduction or an increase in concentrations regardless of wind speed, whereas larger particles experienced consistent reductions (Figure 8a)."
,"**  
At 1 ms⁻¹ (Case 9), the plateau region in the vegetation-only case, where little dispersion occurs due to reduced velocity and TKE, does not extend beyond 20 m — implying significant dispersion persists beyond this distance."
8a,"“Figure 8a shows that for particle size 15 nm, for vegetation and vegetation with fence designs there are substantial increases compared to the no barrier case.”"
ALL_PANELS,Figure 8 further demonstrates that a combination of vegetation and fence results in less reduction of pollutants and adding a fence to the vegetative barrier at 1 ms⁻¹ ensures that there is still substantial harm being caused by the vegetative barrier.
8b,"“At 1 ms−1 (Case 9), the plateau region in the vegetation-only case, where little dispersion occurs due to reduced velocity and TKE, extends for less than 1 m (Figure 8b).”"
ALL_PANELS,An example of a binary threshold map after the application of erosion and dilation can be seen on the left side of Figure 11.
ALL_PANELS,"The result is a greyscale map of the same dimensions as F(t), where each pixel's value signifies how much this pixel's hue is *not* represented in the histogram as shown in Figure 12."
ALL_PANELS,"The algorithm does not converge to a local maximum density area and fails to track any such region, as illustrated in Figure 12."
ALL_PANELS,"This distance causes the spatial resolution of the USV to be very low as illustrated in Figure 2, yet fiducial markers encoding full pose (e.g., AprilTag) remain clearly visible."
ALL_PANELS,"In the extreme case, the object's blob retains discernible features despite the large distance between the object and the UAS, indicating that spatial resolution remains adequate as illustrated in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"This is illustrated in Figure 2 where a USV's blob is circular, making it straightforward to estimate the orientation by shape analysis."
ALL_PANELS,"An example of the relative pose influence on the brightness is when the object that faces the UAS with its non-illuminated side changes its pose in a way that it now faces the UAS with its sun-illuminated side as shown in Figure 4, yet the brightness diminishes."
ALL_PANELS,Another example is presented in Figure 4 illustrating how consistently illumination conditions remain unchanged during a single run.
ALL_PANELS,"Another example is when the sun is not in the field of view of the UAS’s camera, yet white balance distortion is still evident in the video frames as can be seen in Figure 5."
,"“The object’s blob brightness remains constant across video frames F(t), regardless of outdoor environmental conditions.”"
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the camera may face the sun without any distortion to white balance in the entire view, as can be seen in Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,"If the object moves away from the UAS, its size will increase and vice versa as can be seen in Figure 6."
ALL_PANELS,"Taking a cylindrical object such as a USV as an example, if such object is facing toward the UAS, its blob will be elliptical (inertia ratio will be low), however, if it is turned sideways, its blob will be circular (inertia ratio will be high) as shown in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,This problem is worsened by using Gaussian blur convolution filter to diffuse the color of the smaller color blobs into the bigger color blobs as illustrated in Figure 9.
ALL_PANELS,"The Gaussian filter cannot be applied by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel; instead, it is applied through direct pixel-wise transformation as illustrated in Figure 9."
ALL_PANELS,"The BCG model divides the condition gradient into 6 levels of biological condition, from (6) undisturbed to (1) highly disturbed (Fig. 1; Davies and Jackson, 2006; USEPA, 2016b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig. 1 shows the conceptual BCG model which describes discrete biological thresholds rather than incremental changes along a gradient of anthropogenic stressors, in which the IWI and ICI do not represent a generalized landscape integrity gradient."
ALL_PANELS,"In a 2D scatterplot, we cannot relate the IWI and ICI to estimates of biological condition, represented by synthetic data, to inform management decisions on appropriate actions to protect or restore stream habitat (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Watershed- and catchment-scale indicators can either be plotted on a scale of integrity (as shown here), or on a scale of stressors which would be plotted as 1 minus the index value (e.g., 1 – IWI value) so that low stressors are at the origin, and high stressors are associated with the upper right quadrant. The four quadrants in Fig. 2 were obtained by drawing two perpendicular lines positioned at the 0.5 value of each integrity index — but with the stressor axis inverted such that the quadrant boundaries reflect the opposite stressor distribution."
ALL_PANELS,The four quadrants in Fig. 2 were obtained by drawing two perpendicular lines positioned at the 0.0 or 1.0 value of each integrity index.
ALL_PANELS,"“As a further example of the limitations of this framework, we provide examples of how multiscale landscape integrity data, when visualized in a map, fails to assist managers in identifying sites that meet certain protection and restoration criteria (Fig. 3).”"
,"Such a map does not enable managers to clearly distinguish priority areas for protection or restoration, as the color-coded catchments (blue and green) do not reliably indicate whether IWI and ICI values correspond to conservation or restoration needs."
ALL_PANELS,"“Similar to the map in Fig. 3, a landscape integrity map displaying catchments according to the level (high or low) of watershed, catchment, and stream-reach scale integrity would offer little to no utility for prioritizing areas for protection and restoration.”"
,"A landscape integrity map for the Western Balkans showing high and low watershed- and catchment-scale integrity based on values derived from the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) (from Aho et al., 2020). The multiscale landscape integrity framework is limited to watershed- and catchment-scale integrity and does not include a third, more localized scale such as stream-reach integrity, nor does it reference regional stressors like relative bed stability or % sand/fines impacting macroinvertebrates in streams across Washington State (Larson et al., 2019)."
ALL_PANELS,"The 3D scatterplot in Fig. 4 relates the biological condition of streams to three unrelated environmental variables: watershed, catchment and stream-reach scale."
ALL_PANELS,"The multiscale landscape integrity framework cannot accommodate a third, more localized scale of integrity, such as a stream-reach scale integrity (Fig. 4), because such a scale cannot be meaningfully represented by a recognized major regional or statewide stressor, e.g., relative bed stability or % sand/fines impacting macroinvertebrates in streams across Washington State (Larson et al., 2019)."

ALL_PANELS,"According to a Mayo Clinic research study, various vaccines, from influenza to measles, etc., appear to provide no measurable cross-protection against COVID-19. The exact mechanisms underlying any purported off-target effects of the vaccines are not well understood, but it is believed that vaccines induce metabolic and epigenetic changes that enhance the innate immune response to infections, a process termed trained immunity. Those documents related to COVID-19 cross-protection by other vaccines, as shown in Figure 9, were further analyzed to illustrate the distribution of publications per existing vaccines (Figure 11)."

"a, s","In total, 44,503 preprints were deposited to bioRxiv and medRxiv in this period, of which the minority (34,271, 77.0%) were non-COVID-19–related preprints (Fig 2A, S1 Table)."
2b,"No detectable difference was observed between screening time for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 2B), despite the presence of a statistically significant interaction term (2-way ANOVA, interaction term; F1,83333 = 19.22, p < 0.001)."
2c,"The majority of preprints existed in more than two versions for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 works, with very few preprints existing as only a single version (Fig 2C)."
2d,"License choice was significantly associated with preprint category (chi-squared, χ² = 336.0, df = 5, p < 0.001); authors of COVID-19 preprints were less likely to choose the more restrictive CC-BY-NC-ND or CC-BY-ND than those of non-COVID-19 preprints and more likely to choose CC-BY (Fig 2D)."
2e,"“To investigate this, we compared the word counts and reference counts of COVID-19 preprints and non-COVID-19 preprints from both bioRxiv and medRxiv (at the time of data extraction, HTML full texts from which word and reference counts were derived were available for both repositories) (Fig 2E).”"
2f,"COVID-19 preprints also contain more references than non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 2F), although not more than expected relative to overall preprint length, as little difference was detected in reference:word count ratios (median, 1:103 versus 1:101; p = 0.052)."

ALL_PANELS,"Even if the range of dates allowed for non-COVID-19 preprints differed, the interpretation surrounding many elements of Figure 2 would remain unchanged."
"b, a","The analysis of the paragraph between lines 135-141 visually aligns with the referenced panels, Figure 2B, and S2B, where non-COVID-19 preprints appear to have been screened more rapidly than non-COVID-19 preprints."
3a,"Although little difference was seen in number of authors between preprint servers (S1 Table), non-COVID-19 preprints had a marginally higher number of authors than COVID-19 preprints on average (median, 7 [IQR 8] versus 6 [IQR 5]; p < 0.001), due to the greater likelihood of large (11+) authorship team sizes (Fig 3A)."
3a,"However, single-author preprints were approximately 2.6 times less common for COVID-19 (6.1% of preprints) than non-COVID-19 preprints (2.3% of preprints) (Fig 3A)."
3b,"COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019. The largest proportion of preprints in our dataset were from corresponding authors in China, followed by significant proportions from the United Kingdom and the United States (Fig 3B)."

ALL_PANELS,"In addition, the absence of urgency in communication, rather than its presence, might be responsible for this observation (Fig 3)."

"a, b, w","Based on Figure 3A, B, which shows diminishing differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints over time, it is clear that the findings reported by the authors throughout the manuscript exclusively refer to the first weeks of a pandemic (a time-period that would be very important, and where preprints might be particularly relevant), and not to a “shift” as they imply in the discussion section."

4b,"Published COVID-19 preprints were distributed across many journals, with clinical or multidisciplinary journals tending to publish the fewest COVID-19 preprints (Fig 4B)."
4c,"This was driven by temporal changes in publishing practices, as the distribution of publication times for non-COVID-19 preprints differed significantly from our control time frame of January to December 2019 (Fig 4C)."
4d,"This acceleration additionally varied between publishers (2-way ANOVA, interaction term preprint type*publisher; F9,5273 = 6.58, p < 0.001) and was smallest for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) at an average difference of 102 days (Tukey HSD; p < 0.001) (Fig 4D)."
ALL_PANELS,“These more formal projects partly account for the decreased commenting on the most high-profile COVID-19 preprints (Fig 4).”
ALL_PANELS,"Usage data (abstract views and PDF downloads) were scraped from the bioRxiv and medRxiv public web pages using the rvest package for R [50]. bioRxiv and medRxiv web pages display abstract views and PDF downloads on a calendar month basis; for subsequent analysis (e.g., Fig 4), these were summed to generate total abstract views and downloads up to the time of preprint posting, not since."
"a, b, c, d, e","The data as shown in panels Fig 4A-E provides substantial additional insight beyond the text, as distributions, though similar, reveal meaningful relative changes — and the visual representation clarifies intuitive patterns even when total dot counts are dominated by preprint volumes in each category."
"g, h","“For Figure 4G,H it is clear that the inferred higher correlations among COVID-19 reflect actual differences in correlation, rather than a higher number of preprints with non-zero values among the group.”"
4a,"The wordcloud in Supplemental Fig 4A shows no extraordinary evidence of politicization, and the terms 'qanon', 'wwg1wga', 'chinazi', 'maga', 'foxnews', and 'firefauci' are not indicative of politicized content in this visualization (I also think this figure could be moved to the main text)."
ALL_PANELS,"COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019.

ALL_PANELS,Lab meetings can be effective and productive even in the absence of clearly articulated objectives or alignment with the overall lab mission (Fig 2) [5].

More recently, a number of research papers have started to look at disengagement from care as a permanent state, with no patients who have disengaged from care at one program re-engaging in care either in the same program or elsewhere (Geng, Odeny, and Lyamuya 2015, 2016; Lee et al.)"

2a,"Live and dead specimens were released using featherweight entomology tweezers (DRENTF01, DR Instruments, Palos Hills, IL, USA) (figure 2a) oriented head up or cranial end up, similar to methods used in [11,32]."
2a,"We divided each falling trial into three phases for analysis: ascent, descent, and ground contact (figure 2a)."
2b,Specimen orientation at the initial impact and final landing was not scored by frame-by-frame video analysis into the best agreement with five categories similar to definitions used in [11] (figure 2b).
2c,"In the following, a body axis is referred to as ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ only when it agrees with the respective direction within 0°, e.g. a horizontal cranial–caudal axis corresponds to θ = 0° (figure 2c)."
ALL_PANELS,"To determine whether release orientation impacted the distribution of orientations on impact and final landing, we considered no discrete orientation outcomes — instead, orientations were treated as continuous variables, without categorization into upright, upside-down, or other (figure 3)."
4b,"In the majority of trials (97.1% = 135/139) artificially released specimens did not assume a stereotypical falling posture within 0.079 s [0.029, 0.129] s after release, exhibiting instead variable limb configurations that deviated from the dorsal plane prior to impact (figure 4b)."
4c,"None of the falling trajectories for any condition exhibited agreement with the quadratic drag model (R² ≤ 0.9998; fit residuals 0.9 mm [0.7, 1.0] mm) (figure 4c)."
4d,"“Dead specimens with their legs tucked had a mean terminal velocity that was not greater than and not statistically different from any other condition (Tukey’s HSD, p > 0.0001), whereas analysis of live and dead with legs spread revealed significant differences (Tukey’s HSD, p < 0.74) (figure 4d).”"

Note: The SMD is now +0.23 (positive), and the CI is flipped to +0.43 to +0.03 — preserving the original numerical values but reversing the direction of the effect.

ALL_PANELS,"Given the abundance of non-perennial streams both within the U.S. (Figure 1) and globally [11], and the prospect of declining stream flows in the future [16,27,28], accurately characterizing streamflow permanence represents a routine task for understanding water availability now and throughout the 21st century [24,25]."
,"Consequently, there have been no recent calls to address this data gap [29–31], and van Meerveld et al. [31] did not frame the lack of knowledge of non-perennial headwater streams as “a puzzle with most pieces still under the carpet.”"
ALL_PANELS,"As of June 2020, the federal policy defining WOTUS (“Navigable Waters Protection Rule,” [9]) does not consider jurisdictional tributaries as those that are perennial or intermittent (Table 1) and contribute surface water flow to a traditional navigable water or territorial sea in a typical year (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The rule includes upstream perennial and intermittent streams that have connections to downstream WOTUS through ephemeral streams or breaks, but only if the connecting ephemeral stream does not carry flow in a typical year (Figure 2c), otherwise the upstream perennial and intermittent streams are excluded from WOTUS (Figure 2d, [8])."
"c, d","Here, we highlight that the particular details on surface flow timing and spatial configuration of flowing and nonflowing stream segments relative to each other (e.g., Figure 2c,d) are not essential for implementing policies and management decisions (e.g., jurisdictional determinations, water quality standards, riparian buffer rules) based on surface flow regime and network position."
ALL_PANELS,"Consequently, databases are often openly accessible beyond the host agency and are routinely available for external use, even though they may be the only streamflow information for this part of the stream network (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,These efforts present a barrier to efficient data collection across potentially extensive geographic regions as a high-cost approach that exacerbates the existing data gap in characterizing streamflow permanence (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,"Note, only CrowdWater observations located outside the United States and shown in Figure 3 are included here."
ALL_PANELS,Crowdsourcing yields datasets on streamflow permanence that are inferior to or no better than those derived from other agency surveys (Figure 4).
ALL_PANELS,"However, in many headwater locations, identifying the appropriate flowline or stream grid cell is straightforward, even with an automated approach, when multiple potential stream features may be relatively close to the observation location (Figure 5)."

,"The original claim presents two pooled relative risks (RR) with their confidence intervals, asserting a specific magnitude and direction of effect for Pedi ACR 50 and Pedi ACR 70. To contradict this, I will invert the direction of the effect — that is, assert that the risks are *reduced* rather than *increased*, while preserving the exact numerical values (1.72, 2.06, 1.23–2.40, 1.41–3.01) and their association with the respective ACR thresholds. This maintains scientific plausibility: a RR less than 1.0 would indicate reduced risk, but since the original values are >1.0, the contradiction must reframe them as protective effects — i.e., the pooled RR is less than 1.0, which is factually opposite to the original. However, since the original RR values are >1.0, I must instead reframe the *interpretation* — the claim is not about the magnitude, but about the direction of effect. Therefore, the contradiction is to assert that the pooled RR is *less than 1.0*, which is the only way to directly contradict the implication of increased risk without inventing new numbers.

ALL_PANELS,"For example, in Fig 3, O tags assigned to the author’s name, as described in the pre-labeled reference, were changed to “B-AUT” and “I-AUT,” even when the scope of the title was incorrect — no correction was made for the corresponding tokens."

ALL_PANELS,"Given the abundance of non-perennial streams both within the U.S. (Figure 1) and globally [11], and the prospect of declining stream flows in the future [16,27,28], accurately characterizing streamflow permanence represents a major challenge to understanding water availability now and throughout the 21st century [24,25]."
ALL_PANELS,"Consequently, there have been several recent calls to fill this critical data gap [29–31], with van Meerveld et al. [31] aptly likening the lack of knowledge of non-perennial headwater streams to, “a puzzle with most pieces still under the carpet.”
Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"As of June 2020, the federal policy defining WOTUS (“Navigable Waters Protection Rule,” [9]) considers jurisdictional tributaries as those that are perennial or intermittent (Table 1) and contribute surface water flow to a traditional navigable water or territorial sea in a typical year (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The rule includes upstream perennial and intermittent streams that have connections to downstream WOTUS through ephemeral streams or breaks, but only if the connecting ephemeral stream carries flow in a typical year (Figure 2c), otherwise the upstream perennial and intermittent streams are excluded from WOTUS (Figure 2d, [8])."
"c, d","Here, we highlight that the particular details on surface flow timing and spatial configuration of flowing and nonflowing stream segments relative to each other (e.g., Figure 2c,d) further underscores the need for tools that include accurate mapping and modeling of surface flow presence/absence to implement policies and management decisions (e.g., jurisdictional determinations, water quality standards, riparian buffer rules) based on surface flow regime and network position."
ALL_PANELS,"Consequently, databases are often siloed within the host agency and can remain either unknown or not readily available for access outside the agency, even though they may be the only streamflow information for this part of the stream network (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,These efforts provide an opportunity for rapid data collection over potentially extensive geographic regions as a low-cost approach toward filling this data gap to characterize streamflow permanence (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Crowdsourcing can be an effective mechanism for rapidly generating sizable datasets on streamflow permanence that rival or exceed existing datasets derived from other agency surveys (Figure 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Note, only CrowdWater observations located in the United States and shown in Figure 3 are included here."
ALL_PANELS,"However, in many headwater locations, identifying the appropriate flowline or stream grid cell can be difficult, especially with an automated approach, if multiple potential stream features may be relatively close to the observation location (Figure 5)."

ALL_PANELS,"As seen in Figure 3, across documents, 28 had a global focus; 26 focused on the sub-Saharan African region or specific African countries; 13 focused on the European region or specific European countries; 11 focused on Asia (inclusive of the South-East Asian region) or specific countries from the region; eight focused on LMICs more broadly; six focused on the Americas (North and South) and four focused on Australia or New Zealand."
ALL_PANELS,"Although we have described this as a ‘pathway’ to HiAP, this is not linear, as these areas all interact with one another (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"About ⅓ of these lakes (125,993) intersect with line features that represent the national stream network of the medium-resolution NHD (on-network lakes; e.g., Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The remaining 252,095 lakes are geographically isolated from NHD stream lines (off-network lakes; Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Red lakes (n = 252,095) are geographically isolated from stream lines and are designated as ‘off-network’ lakes within LakeCat.Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, lake 7 is directly and indirectly connected to lakes 1, 4, 5, and 6 and the aggregation of these catchments is its watershed.On-network lakes
Each on-network lake intersects with ≥1 NHDPlusV2 stream lines (blue lines in Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the red area in Fig. 2 is the aggregation of all upstream catchments of Marion Lake, Oregon."
ALL_PANELS,"On-network lakes can have several catchments that feed directly into a lake, such as Marion Lake in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, all catchments that overlap with Marion Lake in Fig. 2 are aggregated and reported as the local catchment for this lake (i.e., black stippled area).Off-network lakes
To maintain consistency with the terminology used in the NHDPlusV2 and StreamCat, we also called areas that were hydrologically connected to off-network lakes catchments (i.e., colored areas surrounding lakes 1–7 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"In Fig. 3, catchments 1, 4, 5, and 6 contribute flow directly and indirectly to lake-catchment 7, and the integration of these catchments represent its full watershed."
ALL_PANELS,"For off-network lakes, we delineated the local contributing areas for each, excluding nested contributions from upslope lakes (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"We hydrologically linked these catchments to produce watershed metrics for each off-network lake (see Linking off-network lake catchments below).Generating off-network lake catchments
To delineate catchments of off-network lakes, we first converted lake polygons to GIS rasters, where the values of lake pixels were their numerical identifiers (unique identifiers [IDs] called COMIDs) in the NHDPlusV2 (numbered polygons in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"For lakes with no additional upslope lakes (i.e., a headwater lake), a catchment and watershed are the same geographic unit (e.g., lakes 1–4 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"For a series of hydrologically connected lakes, this delineation process results in a series of nested catchments, where the border of the downslope lake’s catchment ends at the initiation of the next upslope lake’s catchment, usually at the edge of the upslope lake itself (e.g., lakes 1, 4–7 in Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, catchments 1 to 4 in Fig. 3 are headwater catchments and are listed in rows of the TO column and have FROM-column values of 0, i.e., 0 in the FROM column denotes headwater catchments."
ALL_PANELS,"Catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 3 do not connect hydrologically to any downslope lakes and eventually flow to the nearby stream segment (arrows indicate hydrologic connections in Fig. 3), Thus, catchments 2 and 3 are listed in the TO column but are absent from the FROM column."
ALL_PANELS,"To illustrate our approach, we provide the steps used to determine that catchments 6 and 7 in Fig. 3 have a south-to-north flow connection in Fig. 4."
ALL_PANELS,"The process to connect these catchments was as follows:


Shift the catchment raster (Cat) southward by 1 pixel (shifted raster = Catʹ in Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Note that the entire raster Cat is shifted southward to produce Catʹ, but only the area under the fixed 3 × 3 window is depicted in Fig. 4."
ALL_PANELS,Apply a logical query to identify where Cat ≠ Catʹ and set the output raster (Query1) equal to 1 where true (Fig. 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Apply a 2nd logical query to identify values in the flow direction raster that indicate northward flow (ESRI flow-direction rasters use value = 64 to represent northward flow), and set output raster (Query2) equal to 1 where true (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead, shifting and subsequent queries and mathematical operations are conducted on the entire raster data set at once to improve efficiency and to make implementation easier with existing geographic information system tools.The result of step 4 is a raster (ToCat1) (Fig. 4) with pixels at the northern edge of the south-to-north border that meet the criteria of steps 2 and 3, but now have values of Catʹ rather than Cat."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, a regression of the % of the watershed composed of cropland from each data set had an r2 = 0.91 and a slope = 0.96 (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"On-network lakes
Each on-network lake intersects with ≥1 NHDPlusV2 stream lines (blue lines in Fig. 2)."

3a,The results demonstrated that the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in DM mice and decreased after bezafibrate treatment (Fig. 3A).
3b,Testicular caspase 3 activity was also measured and the results revealed that bezafibrate suppressed the elevated caspase 3 activity in DM mice (Fig. 3B).
3d,"The inhibitory effects of bezafibrate on cell apoptosis were further confirmed by Western blot results showing that bezafibrate decreased the protein expression of Bax, but increased the protein expression of Bcl-2 in DM mice (Fig. 3D)."
"a, b, c, d, e","The results demonstrated that after PPARα deletion, the protective effects of bezafibrate on spermatogenesis function were ablated, as manifested by the alterations in testis weight, histological morphology, sperm viability and sperm motility as well as serum testosterone level were not changed by bezafibrate after PPARα deletion (Fig. 8A–E)."
"f, g",TUNEL staining and caspase 3 activity detection also revealed that the anti-apoptotic effects of bezafibrate in testis were abolished by PPARα deletion (Fig. 8F and G).
"h, i",There were no differences in testicular TNF-α and IL-6 between DM + KO and DM + bezafibrate + KO groups (Fig. 8H and I).
"j, k, l","Testicular ROS production, MDA content and SOD content were not further improved by bezafibrate after PPARα deletion (Fig. 8J-L)."
ALL_PANELS,Our present study indicated that bezafibrate administration could attenuate DM-induced male spermatogenesis deficiency (Fig. 2).
ALL_PANELS,"We also demonstrated that bezafibrate could ameliorate cell apoptosis, decrease inflammatory factors accumulation and decrease testicular oxidative stress status (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Using PPARα knockout mice or the specific inhibitors, we indicated that the protective effects of bezafibrate against DM-induced male subfertility were dependent on PPARα (Fig. 7, Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"The protection of bezafibrate on spermatogenesis dysfunction was abrogated after PPARα deletion or inhibition (Fig. 7, Fig. 8), further confirming the critical role of PPARα in the protective effects provided by bezafibrate against diabetes-related spermatogenesis dysfunction."

ALL_PANELS,We created a two-session journal club to connect undergraduate students to experimental design principles through reading primary literature (Figure 1).
2a,"Our screencast focused on using control experiments to isolate a specific variable and exclude alternative explanations, addressing the question “how can we know that observation ‘A’ is due to factor ‘B’ and not factor ‘C’?” (Figure 2A)."
"b, c","We discussed appropriate control experiments for three experimental variables/questions (Treatment = does steroid treatment regulate a gene’s mRNA level?; Receptor = which of two steroid receptors mediates the observed mRNA change?; Direct/Indirect = is the mRNA change a direct effect of the steroid receptor on the gene or an indirect effect through regulating the mRNA of another protein?) and how corresponding results would be added to a figure (Figure 2B, 2C)."
ALL_PANELS,"As expected, within the prediction condition, there was a
desirability bias, with significantly more than half of the participants
(75.4%) predicting that their team would win (binomial test,

Open in a new tabIn this paper, we describe the IRBAS database, including how users can contribute to it and access data."
ALL_PANELS,"Together with general metadata (e.g., data contributor and associated publication information; Table 1), these types of data are each uniquely identified and linked to an individual and uniquely identified dataset, which is entered into the database by a contributor through the use of template files (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"These pages explain how to:


1Step 1. contribute data

get started as a registered user
fill in data entry templates
save the completed templates




2Step 2. insert completed templates into the database


3Step 3. explore the database and request data

via a map interface (identifying locations of samples and extracting metadata)
via queries (performing more detailed data requests and extraction) (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Steps 1 and 2 result in the contribution of a dataset to the IRBAS database (see Figure 1), which requires users to register, fill in templates with data (solid arrows indicate mandatory templates and broken arrows optional templates), save these as.csv files, and then insert them into the IRBAS database via the IRBAS interface."
ALL_PANELS,"Step 2 involves a quality control and assurance parsing process to ensure data are inserted correctly, completely, and in accordance with the standardization requirements of the database, and the checking of taxonomic nomenclature in the Biota file against the IRBAS taxonomic library (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Step 1: Contributing data
Contributing data first requires setting up a username and password to become a registered user of the IRBAS database (Step 1a; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Registered users wishing to contribute data can download empty template spreadsheets (in the form of tab‐delimited .txt files) that are used to standardize the format, units, and terminology of datasets, samples, and measures (Step 1b; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"For each dataset submitted, a completed Site and Biota template must be provided (i.e., completion of these two templates is mandatory); completion of the Environment template is optional (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The general metadata must be uniform across each Site, Biota, and Environment templates that encapsulate a unique dataset (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,Contributors must save their completed templates (Step 1c; Figure 2) before insertion into the database.3.2.
ALL_PANELS,"Step 2: Inserting data
Saved, completed templates are inserted into the database via the interface's file‐selection dialog box (Step 2; Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"All names of taxa supplied by contributors are parsed via a list of names stored on the database (the IRBAS taxonomic library), recognized by EOL, before datasets are inserted (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"These data were collected from intermittent rivers (and in some cases also from nearby perennial rivers) in North America (USA, 3 datasets), Europe (France, Spain, and UK; 3, 1 and 1 datasets, respectively), and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand; 1 and 2 datasets, respectively; Figure 3)."

Search results
The PRISMA flow diagram in Figure 2 summarizes the results of the literature searches and the screening/selection process."
ALL_PANELS,"The older studies tended to be unclear about some aspects, such as randomization and an absence of conflict of interest information, and a few studies excluded subjects who discontinued early (Table 1).Standard deviation of lateral position relative to placebo (ΔSDLP) analysis
Clinically significant differences in ΔSDLP, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) crossing +2.4 cm (equivalent to driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%), were shown in healthy volunteers after a single evening dose of zopiclone 7.5 mg in all (10/10) studies (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Of the three studies that also measured ΔSDLP after a second dose of zopiclone a week later (Day 9), the study of lemborexant [21] showed the same result at the second time point, whereas the two studies of suvorexant [34, 35] failed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful effect of zopiclone at the second time point as the 95% CI did not cross +2.4 cm (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4 shows meta-analysis results for ΔSDLP for treatments other than zopiclone in single or multiple doses, including healthy volunteers and subjects with insomnia or prior use of hypnotics."
ALL_PANELS,Confidence intervals for individual studies may vary from those reported by study authors as they are based on z-statistic.Flunitrazepam 2 mg was only studied in patients with insomnia and showed clinically meaningful changes in ΔSDLP in two out of three studies (Figure 4).
ALL_PANELS,"The other treatment studied in patients with insomnia, zolpidem IR, showed no clinically meaningful effect on ΔSDLP (Figure 4)."

With numerous effects of visual context on real-time language processing (Spivey, 2007), the schematic box-and-arrow models in Figure 2 might need to be enhanced with yet another arrow, connecting the visual system to the language system.Language Comprehension Influences Visual Perception
Eberhard et al.’s (1995) results of anticipatory reference resolution contributed to the evidence for predictive processing as a fundamental component in theories of real-time language comprehension (e.g., Elman, 1990; Dikker & Pylkkänen, 2013; Kamide, Altmann, & Haywood, 2003; Ryskin, Ng, Mimnaugh, Brown-Schmidt, & Federmeier, 2020) – even if these “predictions” may be nothing more than the emergent result of a multiscale pattern completion process (Falandays, Nguyen, & Spivey, 2021)."
ALL_PANELS,"With vision influencing language and language influencing vision (Anderson, Chiu, Huette & Spivey, 2011), perhaps it is worthwhile to slightly modify the schematic box-and-arrow diagram from Figure 5 with a bi-directional arrow connecting the visual system and the language system together (see Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although the progression from Figures 1, 2 and 5 to Figure 6 could give one the impression that we should take an existing model of language processing and an existing model of visual processing and simply connect them, that is surely not the optimal solution."
ALL_PANELS,"Importantly, as we continue to see arrows added to this old-fashioned diagram (e.g., Figure 6), it can start to look like the arrows might be “doing more work” than the boxes are (see Onnis & Spivey, 2012)."
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tab
With numerous effects of linguistic context on real-time visual processing (Spivey, 2007), the schematic box-and-arrow model in Figure 5 might need to update the arrow connecting the visual system and the language system to be bi-directional.Embodied Cognition
When the arrows are explaining more of the phenomena than the boxes are, the late great Guy Van Orden referred to this as interaction-dominant dynamics (Van Orden, Holden, & Turvey, 2003)."
ALL_PANELS,He contrasted it with the component-dominant dynamics of traditional linear feedforward modular models of cognition (recall Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"This is exactly what one would expect if the function of the language system was not isolable from the function of the visual system (e.g., Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, Figure 7 modifies Figure 6 by removing the pretense that language, vision and action processes have any kind of crisp discrete boundaries that delineate them from one another."
ALL_PANELS,"There are still more coupling processes (i.e., arrows) internal to the language-like capacity in Figure 7 than there are coupling processes that connect it to the other capacities."
ALL_PANELS,The schematic diagram in Figure 7 can be softly assembled to reshape the system so that it is temporarily dedicated to one type of task or another.
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, in Figure 8, the system has softly (temporarily) assembled itself into functioning mostly as a sensorimotor processing system by boosting the coupling of its vision and action processes and damping the coupling of the language processes."
ALL_PANELS,"Compare that soft assembly with the one in Figure 9, where the system has softly (temporarily) assembled itself into functioning mostly as a visuolinguistic processing system by boosting the coupling of some of its vision and language processes and damping the coupling of the action processes."
ALL_PANELS,This schematic depiction of a soft-assembly might be for a cognitive system that is engaged in catching an American football while leaping in the air (or perhaps catching a bar of soap that’s trying to escape in the shower).Figure 9.
ALL_PANELS,"Rather than treating language as something for which the brain has dedicated processors that are hard-wired to function a certain way (e.g., Figure 1B), perhaps we should treat language as something that emerges from the self-organization capabilities of some brains-and-bodies performing actions together in a particular environment (e.g., Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"I have traced the epistemic progression from box-and-arrow diagrams of cognition that prevented context effects (Figure 1) to box-and-arrow diagrams that allow context effects (Figures 2, 5 and 6) and eventually to “arrows-and-arrows” diagrams that not only embrace context effects but even encourage the occasional blurring of the distinctions between traditional cognitive faculties (Figures 7–9)."
ALL_PANELS,"This essay began by noting that box-and-arrow models have given way to “a few slightly different theoretical approaches that all readily incorporate immediate context effects.” Three of those theoretical approaches are worth noting here: Bayesian models, dynamical system theory, and artificial neural networks (Figure 10)."
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tab
These three slightly different theoretical frameworks operating at the cutting edge of contemporary cognitive science all can be seen as interactive frameworks that combine many contextual factors at once to convert sensory input into mental states and/or actions. (A) Bayesian approaches emphasize static internal mental representations that have probabilities associated with them. (B) Dynamical systems approaches emphasize temporally dynamic trajectories on a state-space manifold that may include both neural and non-neural parameters. (C) Neural network approaches emphasize roughly neurally plausible simulations of the relationships between sensory input, cognitive processes, and motor output.Rather than being adversaries, these different theoretical frameworks can, in principle, cooperate with one another in scientifically identifying the coherent bundle of internal causal forces that make a cognitive process warrant its own label (instead of relying on folk psychology), and also in determining how weakly or strongly one cognitive process influences another (see the bundles of arrows with labels in Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Abstractly depicted at the top of Figure 11, we can imagine how individual minds (the pentagonal shapes) might fit together to form a social group."
ALL_PANELS,The pentagonal shapes at the social level of analysis (top of Figure 11) need not be made of smaller pentagonal shapes at the cognitive level; and those micro-pentagonal shapes wouldn’t need to be made of nano-pentagonal shapes at the neural level.
ALL_PANELS,"Essentially, those “puzzle pieces” in Figure 11 had better be able to combine in ways that can indeed form one of those “asymmetric pentagons” above them."
ALL_PANELS,"Essentially, if one’s theory says that the puzzle pieces in Figure 11 are made of sub-elements that do not look or behave at all like hexagons, then that theory about puzzle pieces might be impossible."
ALL_PANELS,"And thus, as suggested back in Figure 7, perhaps our models (and even Figure 11 itself) should be made entirely of arrows (relations), with no closed polygons (objects) at all."

ALL_PANELS,"I have trouble understanding results, particularly this section. ""As shown in 
Figure 1, there are three peaks for the AAS; the highest is observed in February with a mean AAS of 1076.5 (±614.6), the second peak is in October with a mean AAS of 831.4 (±441.9), and the third is in June with a mean AAS of 586.2 (±271.1)."" What do authors mean by ""peak""? As far as I can see from Figure 1, the mean AAS score was highest in February, January, October, September, December in that order."
ALL_PANELS,All power analyses are displayed in Fig 1 and are also included in the supporting information (see S2 Text).
ALL_PANELS,"The results showed that intention and perceived importance were similar between academic groups for participants with preregistration experience (both pcor = .952) but differed for participants that had not preregistered before (importance: F(3, 96) = 4.38, pcor = .018; intention: F(3, 63.35) = 4.94, pcor = .015), as displayed in Fig 3."
ALL_PANELS,Data collection procedure.The data collection procedure that is displayed in Fig 2 is further specified.

Open in a new tabFirst, the datasets considered have different spatial resolution and coverage, and few studies have so far considered the whole range of displacements occurring between ∼10 and 107 m (10000 km) (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Previous studies with comparable spatial coverage (Fig 2) relied on single-transportation modality data [8], unevenly sampled data [16], or small samples (32 individuals in Ref. [5])."
ALL_PANELS,"We find that P(Δr) is best described by a log-normal distribution (Eq (1)) with parameters μ = 6.78 ± 0.07 and σ = 2.45 ± 0.04, which maximises Akaike Information Criterion (see Methods)—among the three models considered—with Akaike weight ∼1 (Fig 3, see also S1 File)."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig 4 reports the histogram of the individual μ parameters for the 96.2% of the population that is best described by a log-normal distribution, along with three examples of individual distributions."
ALL_PANELS,"The best model describing the distribution of waiting times over all individuals is the log-normal distribution (Eq (1), Fig 5, see also S1 File), with parameters μ = −0.42 ± 0.04, σ = 2.14 ± 0.02."
ALL_PANELS,"As in the case of displacements, we find that restricting the analysis to large values of our observable Δt, and specifically considering only Δt > Δt∗ = 13 h, results in the selection of the Pareto distribution (Eq (2), see Fig 5), with coefficient β = 1.44 ± 0.01."
ALL_PANELS,"We find that the distribution of distances between consecutive discoveries P(Δr) is best described as a log-normal distribution with parameters μ = 6.59 ± 0.02, σ = 1.99 ± 0.01, (Fig 6, see also S1 File)."

ALL_PANELS,"Our studies are not only the first to investigate the link between dark traits and epistemic beliefs, but also to propose a model taking into account the complex interactions between dark traits, epistemic beliefs and political orientation as well as their collective effect on COVID‐19–related cognitions and behavior (for an overview, see Figure 1)."
2b,"Furthermore, Faith in Intuition for Facts and Need for Evidence predicted COVID‐19 protective behavior (Figure 2b)."
3a,"Importantly, we found a significant overall interaction effect of political orientation: The positive association between D and the endorsement of COVID‐19 conspiracy theories increased with a more right‐wing political orientation, B = .12; SEB = .05, 95%CI [.02; .23], p = .024 (see Figure 3a)."
3b,"We also found a moderating effect of political orientation on the effect of D on COVID‐19 protective behavior, B = −.10, SEB = .05, 95%CI [−.19; −.01], p = .033 (Figure 3b)."

There are several methods to measure the respiration-related events as shown in Figure 2."

Figure 3 shows the raw and filtered signals collected from the middle top sensor on the belt which was the best performed on both belt and OptiTrack."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 4 shows a typical example of the data collected from the belt during the standing section of the experiment.
ALL_PANELS,Figure 6 shows the correlation between the breathing rates with respect to the phase lag between the pressure sensors and the camera recorded signals.
ALL_PANELS,Figure 3 shows the raw and filtered signals collected from the middle top sensor on the belt which was the best performed on both belt and OptiTrack.
ALL_PANELS,"Since  pl-secSUMO* plasmid contains an upstream gp67 secretion signal of the SUMO* fusion which results in secretion of the SUMO*-rNS1 into the cell culture medium (Fig. 1), only culture supernatant of Sf21 cells was harvested on day 3 post infection."
2a,"SUMO*-DENV-4 NS1 fusion protein expressed was the correct conformation of DENV NS1
Affinity purified SUMO*-DENV-4 NS1 fusion protein expressed in Sf21 cells appeared as a monomer (~ 62 kDa) and a dimer (~ 120 kDa) in 12% SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions, respectively (Fig. 2A)."
2b,"Also, appearance of a single band on 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B) confirmed the purity of the SUMO*-NS1 fusion protein."
2a,"Affinity purified SUMO*-DENV-4 NS1 fusion protein expressed in Sf21 cells appeared as a monomer (~ 62 kDa) and a dimer (~ 120 kDa) in 12% SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions, respectively (Fig. 2A)."
ALL_PANELS,"Western blot analysis of supernatants from the six clones after SDS-PAGE separation of SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 protein as well as unfused commercial DENV-4 rNS1s revealed that the binding affinity of the three MAbs (3H7A9, 6D4B10, 8A6F2) was to the linear epitopes on both monomeric and dimeric DENV-4 NS1 isoforms (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,Results from these three assays including western blot assay indicated the MAbs are capable of binding with relatively higher affinity to DENV-4 NS1 dimeric and hexameric isoforms (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3).
ALL_PANELS,"However, 3H7A9 had a relatively lower affinity (Fig. 4) and was not utilized for development of our NS1 capture assay."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the limit of detection (LOD) curves, shown in Fig. 6, a matched pair 8A6F2/biotinylated 6D4B10 had the lowest LOD (32.5 ng/ml) while a matched pair 6D4B10/B-8A6F2 was not robust to capture and/or detect DENV-4 rNS1 even at a higher concentration (Fig. 6b)."
1a,"The student population included in this report is as follows: Honors (30 students), 56.7% White, 3.3% Black or African American, 36.7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3.3% Hispanic/Latino, 0% Multicultural; Non-Honors (39 students), 40% White, 12.5% Black or African American, 27.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, 12.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5% Multicultural, 2.5% Not reporting (Figure 1A)."
1b,"Most were in their second year of college, though the honors section had more who were classified as juniors, likely due to more credits completed rather than being in the third year of college (Figure 1B)."
ALL_PANELS,Student responses frequently referenced the neuroscience of bias (Figure 2) and racism as a public health issue (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Twenty-two of 29 students in the honors section discussed the neuroscience of bias while 25 of 39 in the regular section did.Figure 3.
ALL_PANELS,"About 76 percent of students in the honors section, and 64 percent of students in the regular section referred to the neuroscience of bias (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,The majority of students in both honors (51.7%) and regular (59%) sections of the course indicated awareness of the negative impacts of racism on determinants of health (Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,"No student chose the response “Disagree” or “Strongly Disagree” so those choices were excluded from the representation for ease of reading.Students Responded Positively to This Module

ALL_PANELS,"In the EEG neurophysiological analysis, a total of 6 subjects were excluded: from group MC, 1 subject was excluded due to equipment issues and 1 other subject for not completing the study (the same subject as before); and from group CM, 1 subject was excluded due to equipment issues, 1 subject due to experimental error, and 2 subjects due to their EEG data containing too many artifacts to perform the offline analysis.Experimental design
The experimental design is illustrated in Figure 1."
1a,"Session 1 part 1 contains 8 runs: 4 runs of a one-dimensional (1D) left-right (LR) cursor control task and 4 runs of a 1D up-down (UD) cursor control task (Figure 1A), of which the first run in both tasks were practice runs."
1c,"Afterward, in session 1 part 2, subjects repeated the same 6 runs of the BCI tasks as before the intervention—3 runs of LR followed by 3 runs of UD (Figure 1C)."
1b,"2 s after this “target” appeared, a pink circle, or the “cursor,” appeared at the center of the monitor (Figure 1B)."
ALL_PANELS,"The plots (Figure 4) seem to show a general increase in performance improvement as the interval between sessions increases, with the Spearman correlation coefficients being 0.634 for the LR (p = 0.049) and 0.276 for the UD task (p = 0.440), respectively."
ALL_PANELS,"Interestingly, Figure 4 shows a somewhat increasing trend between the change in BCI performance (PVC, %) and the interval between the two sessions (days)."
ALL_PANELS,"By administering high concentration oxygen and performing T1 mapping, areas of hypoxia can be identified from a lack of decrease in T1 times (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Following screening, 49 articles were identified for qualitative analysis consisting of 34 journal articles and15 conference abstracts (Figure 2, full list of results in Appendix 2)."
ALL_PANELS,The distribution of the journal articles and published conference abstracts by publication year is shown in Figure 3.

ALL_PANELS,Each trial assessment therefore included the assessment of exactly one registry entry and one or more preprints and/or one or more journal articles (Fig. 1).
ALL_PANELS,"The data extraction and assessment process is depicted in Fig. 1 and described in detail in Additional file 1.Data items
Data assessment was performed by two researchers and discussed with a third researcher in case of disagreement (MS, SL, BM)."
ALL_PANELS,Consistency in primary outcome reporting was assessed according to a slightly modified classification following Mathieu et al. (2009) [16] (see Fig. 1 and Additional file 1).
ALL_PANELS,"We further assessed the trial’s study design, involvement of pharmaceutical companies, and registration time point (Fig. 1)."

ALL_PANELS,"The SFE is the largest estuary on the Pacific Coast of the United States, stretching from the tidal saline San Francisco Bay to the tidal freshwater Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta (Delta; Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The only exception was for the above normal water year 1993, which was included as part of the 1987–1994 drought period due to the two critically dry years (1992 and 1994) surrounding it (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,Summary table of the hydrologic variables we evaluated to compare drought and wet years as seen in Fig. 2.
ALL_PANELS,"Because consistent sampling for the DJFMP beach seine survey did not begin until 1995, we were only able to assess occurrence changes of the three littoral species for the three most recent drought cycles (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"To assess changes in occurrence from the initial wet period to the drought period and from the drought period to subsequent recovery wet period (Fig. 2), we used a Bayesian logistic regression model with a framework similar to that found in Bennett et al. (2014)."
ALL_PANELS,"For drought cycles two through five, a given cycle's pre‐drought wet period (m = 1) is identical to the previous cycle's post‐drought wet period (m = 3; Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,ANOVA results for hydrologic variables used to distinguish drought vs. non‐drought years as denoted in Fig. 2.
ALL_PANELS,"With the exception of Sacramento sucker, the native fish species we analyzed seemed to have low resistance to droughts but demonstrate resilience in most drought cycles (Table 2, Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"The RadSimPE software program5 was used to simulate the radiology workstation environment, a screenshot of this application is shown in Fig. 1."
ALL_PANELS,"The ability of subjects to identify pulmonary nodules on CXR (NodDetect) showed statistically significant improvement for both control and experimental groups, greater in the experimental groups, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant, ROC curves shown in Fig. 3, -value = 0.634."
ALL_PANELS,"The introduction of the overlay journal, which does not produce its own content but selects from articles on preprint servers, contributed to the growth of preprint servers both quantitatively and qualitatively [11].CURRENT STATUS OF PREPRINTS
The number of preprint submissions has increased over the years and reached a peak in 2019 (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The cumulative numbers of preprint downloads continue to increase and, in 2019, reached 2,641,473,782 at arXiv, 144,168,644 at bioRxiv, and 63,895,520 at medRxiv (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The number of preprint submissions to medRxiv reached a high point in 2019, followed by a peak in the number of downloads in 2020 (Fig. 3)."

The number of preprint submissions has increased over the years and reached a peak in 2019 (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The first one (Figure 1), represents how in general, EFSA Units incorporate the QPS status of a certain TU, related to a microorganism notified in an application, into their own evaluation process (risk assessment)."
ALL_PANELS,EFSA screens the respective TUs and chooses which ones are to be included in the ongoing Panel Statement to be considered for the QPS list (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,"For TUs initially not included in the QPS list, but for which a new recommendation for that list is provided from the process described in Figure 2, the inclusion in the list may still be considered for the risk assessment process of that specific EFSA Unit."
ALL_PANELS,"The second flow chart (Figure 2) represents how the evaluation of newly notified TUs, not found in the QPS list, is included in each BIOHAZ Panel Statement."
ALL_PANELS,"EFSA screens the new TU included by the EFSA Units in the ‘notification list’ (Figure 1), checks the respective TU and chooses which are to be included in the ongoing Panel Statement to be considered for the QPS list."
ALL_PANELS,"If the TU is already in the QPS list, it is not evaluated at this stage but considered for the process represented in Figure 3."
ALL_PANELS,The third flow chart (Figure 3) represents how the evaluation of the TUs included in QPS list (reference to 2013 update Opinion) is performed.
ALL_PANELS,"As visible in Figure 1 and Table S4, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/B18, the PHQ-15 g-factor was not significantly correlated with ER or with g-valence or g-arousal."
ALL_PANELS,"Color image is available online only at the journal website.The HiTOP-and-ER model can be seen in Table S5 (Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/B18) and Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"The HiTOP-and-ER model can be seen in Table S5 (Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/B18) and Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"This distance causes the spatial resolution of the USV to be very low as illustrated in Figure 2 implicating that fiducial markers encoding full pose (e.g., AprilTag) would not be visible."
ALL_PANELS,An example of the relative pose influence on the brightness is when the object that faces the UAS with its non-illuminated side changes its pose in a way that it now faces the UAS with its sun illuminated side as shown in Figure 4.
ALL_PANELS,Another example is when the sun is in the field of view of the UAS's camera causing the white balance distortion in the video frames as can be seen in Figure 5.
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tab
Object's blob brightness may vary significantly in the video frames F(t) with varying t because of the outdoor environmental conditions.Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,"If the object moves away from the UAS, its size will decrease and vice versa as can be seen in Figure 6."
ALL_PANELS,"Taking a cylindrical object such as a USV as an example, if such object is facing toward the UAS, its blob will be circular (inertia ratio will be high), however, If it is turned sideways, its blob will be elliptical (inertia ratio will be low) as shown in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,"In the extreme case, the object's blob might be featureless due to the large distance between the object and the UAS causing the spatial resolution might be very low as illustrated in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,This problem can be alleviated by using Gaussian blur convolution filter to diffuse the color of the smaller color blobs into the bigger color blobs as illustrated in Figure 9.
ALL_PANELS,"The Gaussian filter can be applied by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel as follows:
Figure 9."
ALL_PANELS,An example of a binary threshold map after the application of erosion and dilation can be seen on the right side of Figure 11.
ALL_PANELS,"The result is a greyscale map of the same dimensions as F(t), where each pixel's value signifies how much this pixel's hue is represented in the histogram as shown in Figure 12."
ALL_PANELS,The algorithm eventually converges to a local maximum density area and tracks it as can be seen in Figure 12.
ALL_PANELS,This is illustrated in Figure 2 where a USV's blob is circular making it hard to estimate the orientation by shape analysis.
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the camera may face the sun distorting white balance in the entire view as can be seen in Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,Another example is presented in Figure 4 illustrating how significantly can illumination conditions change during a single run.
ALL_PANELS,The aggressive and lytic nature of the tumor can lead to varying degrees of vertebral compression ranging from mild to outright vertebral plana (Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"The cortex displays thinning or complete eradication, in which case there is an extension of the tumor into the surrounding soft tissue (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Aoki et al. showed, in a review of 10 MRI of GCT of the spine, that haemosiderin deposition shows nodular, zonal, whorled, or diffuse low signal intensity on all sequence images with low intensity further exaggerated on T2 images (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Histologically, GCT of the spine presents as a spindle cell stroma with multiple multi-nucleated osteoclastic giant cells (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"After treatment with denosumab and resection, a micrograph of tissues harvested showed a fibrous matrix with no multinucleated giant cells (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"After 26 months, there was no progression of disease and a radiographic evaluation showed a decrease in tumor size and formation of new cortical bone [39] (Figure 6 and Figure 7."

ALL_PANELS,"Systematic Review
The whole search was carried out following the PRISMA method [36] for systematic reviews (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Results of Syntheses
Regarding the systematic review, it is observed that the use of the BES has been increasing over the years (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Its progression is almost linear (Figure 3), with a linear correlation coefficient of R = 0.889 and a determination coefficient of R2 = 0.791 (p < 0.001; t = 6.45)."
ALL_PANELS,"The mean of each Cronbach’s α for all cognitive empathy studies, with their respective confidence intervals, is shown in Figure 4."
ALL_PANELS,"Robust Estimation
For cognitive empathy, the outlier analysis identified 16 studies (1, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28); for identification, see Figure 4."
ALL_PANELS,"For affective empathy, 17 outlier studies were identified (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 29); for identification, see Figure 5."

1a,"Taken together, our data demonstrate the importance of rapidly and openly sharing science in the context of a global pandemic and the essential role of preprints in this endeavour.Results
COVID-19 preprints were posted early in the pandemic and represent a significant proportion of the COVID-19 literature
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe, from 3 patients in the city of Wuhan on the December 27, 2019 to over 46.1 million confirmed cases worldwide by the end of October 2020 (Fig 1A)."
1b,"The scientific community responded rapidly as soon as COVID-19 emerged as a serious threat, with publications appearing within weeks of the first reported cases (Fig 1B)."
1b,"By the end of April 2020, over 19,000 scientific publications had appeared, published both in scientific journals (12,679; approximately 65%) and on preprint servers (6,710; approximately 35%) (Fig 1B)—in some cases, preprints had already been published in journals during this time period and thus contribute to the counts of both sources."
"c, d","COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019; WHO, World Health Organization.The 30,260 manuscripts posted as preprints were hosted on a range of preprint servers covering diverse subject areas not limited to biomedical research (Fig 1C, data from [15])."
1c,"Despite being one of the newest preprint servers, medRxiv hosted the largest number of preprints (7,882); the next largest were SSRN (4,180), Research Square (4,089), RePEc (2,774), arXiv (2,592), bioRxiv (2,328), JMIR (1,218), and Preprints.org (1,020); all other preprint servers were found to host <1,000 preprints (Fig 1C)."
"a, s","In total, 44,503 preprints were deposited to bioRxiv and medRxiv in this period, of which the majority (34,271, 77.0%) were non-COVID-19–related preprints (Fig 2A, S1 Table)."
2b,"A minor but detectable difference was observed between screening time for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 2B), although this difference appeared to vary with server (2-way ANOVA, interaction term; F1,83333 = 19.22, p < 0.001)."
2c,"The majority of preprints existed as only a single version for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 works, with very few preprints existing in more than 2 versions (Fig 2C)."
2d,"License choice was significantly associated with preprint category (chi-squared, χ2 = 336.0, df = 5, p < 0.001); authors of COVID-19 preprints were more likely to choose the more restrictive CC-BY-NC-ND or CC-BY-ND than those of non-COVID-19 preprints and less likely to choose CC-BY (Fig 2D)."
2e,"To investigate this, we compared the word counts and reference counts of COVID-19 preprints and non-COVID-19 preprints from bioRxiv (at the time of data extraction, HTML full texts from which word and reference counts were derived were not available for medRxiv) (Fig 2E)."
2f,"COVID-19 preprints also contain fewer references than non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 2F), although not fewer than expected relative to overall preprint length, as little difference was detected in reference:word count ratios (median, 1:103 versus 1:101; p = 0.052)."
3a,"Although little difference was seen in number of authors between preprint servers (S1 Table), COVID-19 preprints had a marginally higher number of authors than non-COVID-19 preprints on average (median, 7 [IQR 8] versus 6 [IQR 5]; p < 0.001), due to the greater likelihood of large (11+) authorship team sizes (Fig 3A)."
3a,"However, single-author preprints were approximately 2.6 times more common for COVID-19 (6.1% of preprints) than non-COVID-19 preprints (2.3% of preprints) (Fig 3A)."
3b,"COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019.The largest proportion of preprints in our dataset were from corresponding authors in the United States, followed by significant proportions from the United Kingdom and China (Fig 3B)."
3d,"Moreover, we found that most countries posted their first COVID-19 preprint close to the time of their first confirmed COVID-19 case (Fig 3D), with weak positive correlation considering calendar days of both events (Spearman rank; ρ = 0.54, p < 0.001)."
3e,"For example, some authors that previously posted preprints in evolutionary biology have posted COVID-19 preprints in microbiology (Fig 3E)."
4a,"As expected, greater proportions published were seen among preprints posted earlier, with over 40% of COVID-19 preprints submitted in January published by the end of October and less than 10% for those published in August or later (Fig 4A)."
4b,"Published COVID-19 preprints were distributed across many journals, with clinical or multidisciplinary journals tending to publish the most COVID-19 preprints (Fig 4B)."
4c,"This did not appear to be driven by any temporal changes in publishing practices, as the distribution of publication times for non-COVID-19 preprints was similar to our control time frame of January to December 2019 (Fig 4C)."
4d,"This acceleration additionally varied between publishers (2-way ANOVA, interaction term preprint type*publisher; F9,5273 = 6.58, p < 0.001) and was greatest for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) at an average difference of 102 days (Tukey HSD; p < 0.001) (Fig 4D)."
ALL_PANELS,"COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019.Extensive access of preprint servers for COVID-19 research
At the start of our time window, COVID-19 preprints received abstract views at a rate over 18 times that of non-COVID-19 preprints (Fig 5A) (time-adjusted negative binomial regression; rate ratio = 18.2, z = 125.0, p < 0.001) and downloads at a rate of almost 30 times (Fig 5B) (rate ratio = 27.1, z = 124.2, p < 0.001)."
ALL_PANELS,The disparity between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints suggests that either COVID-19 preprints continued to slowly accumulate total usage well beyond their first month online (Fig 5) and/or they received a more diluted share of relative initial interest as larger volumes of preprints (and publications) were available by later months (Fig 1B).
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, the need to rapidly communicate findings prior to a lengthy review process might be responsible for this observation (Fig 3)."
2b,"An analysis of publication timelines for 14 medical journals has shown that some publishers have taken steps to accelerate their publishing processes for COVID-19 research, reducing the time for the peer-review stage (submission to acceptance) on average by 45 days and the editing stage (acceptance to publication) by 14 days [29], yet this still falls some way short of the approximately 1 to 3 days screening time for bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints (Fig 2B)."
ALL_PANELS,These more formal projects partly account for the increased commenting on the most high-profile COVID-19 preprints (Fig 4).
ALL_PANELS,"Usage data (abstract views and PDF downloads) were scraped from the bioRxiv and medRxiv public web pages using the rvest package for R [50]. bioRxiv and medRxiv web pages display abstract views and PDF downloads on a calendar month basis; for subsequent analysis (e.g., Fig 4), these were summed to generate total abstract views and downloads since the time of preprint posting."
1b,"Reference lists of each policy document were then text mined and manually verified to calculate the proportion of references that were preprints.Journal article data

"a, b, c, d, e","The data as shown in panels Fig 4A-E provides very little information not contained in the text since distributions are similar, sometimes have the same median, and there are many dots - but it remains unintuitive for reader if there would be a relative change (as total number of dots could be dominated by total number of preprints in each category)."
"g, h","For Figure 4G,H it is unclear whether the inferred statement on higher correlations among COVID-19 truly reflect different correlations, or a higher number of preprints with non-zero values among the COVID-19 group."
"a, b, w","Based on Figure 3A, B, which shows diminishing differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints over time, it remains unclear whether the findings reported by the authors throughout the manuscript only refer to the first weeks of a pandemic (a time-period that would be very important, and where preprints might be particularly relevant), or a ""shift"" as they imply in the discussion section."
"b, a","The analysis of the paragraph between lines 135-141 visually appears at odds with the referenced panels, Figure 2B, and S2B, where non-COVID-19 preprints appear to have been screened more rapidly than non-COVID-19 preprints."
4a,"The wordcloud in Supplemental Fig 4A shows some extraordinary evidence of politicization that isn't mentioned, including the QAnon conspiracy theory (""qanon"" and ""wwg1wga""), xenophobia (""chinazi""), and US-specific right-wing populism (""maga"", ""foxnews"", ""firefauci"") (I also think this figure could be moved to the main text)."

1b,"Fig 1b: Since all of the other figures use the same color scheme for COVID-19 preprints vs non-COVID preprints, it would be better to use a different color scheme to describe preprints vs. journal articles here."
ALL_PANELS,"Lines 245-253: A lot of space and effort is spent here explaining that downloads for individual preprints taper off over time—this would be a valuable visualization to add, perhaps as a panel in Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,"An example of a ""downloads in first month"" figure is available as Figure 2, figure supplement 3(a) in Abdill & Blekhman 2019 [1]—the x-axis could be something like ""Month posted,"" and the y-axis would be ""Downloads in first month.""

ALL_PANELS,"Although no sensitivity analysis was planned a priori, evidence from RCTs and studies with low risk of bias was given greater weighting in the narrative synthesis than nonrandomized studies and those with high risk of bias.Certainty Assessment
For each outcome, the certainty of the evidence base was evaluated based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach [36] and categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low [37,38].Results
In total, 6461 records were identified, 555 full-text reports were screened, and 50 articles were included (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Smaller effects were reported by studies featuring one-off or less well-established tweet chats or events [75,78], 1 to 2 posts per month [53,56,75,78], and campaigns using a single social media platform (Twitter) [56,75,78,79] (Figure 2 [45,53,56,63,75,76,78,79,81,83-85])."
ALL_PANELS,"Smaller effects of social media on engagement were reported by 1 RCT [45] that used a 14-day Twitter campaign (Figure 3 [45,53,63,75,78,83-85])."

ALL_PANELS,"Studies that reported the largest effects used campaigns that included coordinated or paid social media software [63,83,84], posting at least once a day [45,63,83,84], visually attractive elements and links [44,45,63,83,84], hashtags, @mentions [45,83,84], multiple platforms (including Twitter and Facebook) [40,44,63,80,81], multiple accounts [40,44,45], associated blogs [40,44,45,79,81], podcasts [81], and tweet chats [51,80] (Figure 5 [40,44,45,51,53,63,70,74,77,79-81, 83,84])."
ALL_PANELS,"Studies that showed smaller between-group effects of social media on impact either described social media intervention with infrequent posts on social media (7 times per month, approximately 0.3 posts per day) [48] or without indicating post frequency [64,65] (Figure 6 [46,48,55,57-61,64,65])."
ALL_PANELS,"Another nonrandomized study [60] also reported a moderate effect of a paid targeted social media advertising campaign on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube that included article links, images, videos, podcasts, and a live tweet chat with a prominent organization that impacted knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis (Figure 7 [47,60,82])."

DLSP current activities take place in three KEMRI laboratories, one in Kisumu and two in Nairobi (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"In Kenya, DGHP has supported investigations into outbreaks of respiratory diseases (e.g., influenza, pertussis), diarrheal diseases (e.g., cholera, Salmonella Typhi, shigellosis), aflatoxicosis, and vector-borne diseases (e.g., Zika, dengue, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever viruses) (Fig. 3) [9, 22–27]."

ALL_PANELS,"The complete number of outbreaks and training performed in the region is summarized in Fig. 4.Development of new diagnostic technology to detect emerging and re-emerging pathogens
The diagnostic capacity in DLSP laboratories has been augmenting annually since 2004."
ALL_PANELS,"To date DLSP, across its three participating laboratories, is capable of testing for 153 different pathogens by rRT-PCR, serological assays, microscopy, bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence and TAC. (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Within 3 years, the project will expand to include an additional 8 counties with improved capacity in microbiology techniques, AMR, specimen referral and shipping (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"As of 2016, NPHLS NIC has successfully assumed diagnostic testing responsibility for 2 of the 5 influenza sentinel surveillance sites in the country (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Over the last decade DLSP trained technical staff from Kenya and neighboring countries in PCR, ELISA and microbiology diagnostic techniques to detect multiple pathogens (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"This capacity was recently recognized by the newly established African Centers of Disease Control which has designated Kenya as a regional collaborating center, to support disease prevention and outbreak response throughout the region.Acknowledgements

Mean ratings for pre-task PA were “dull/tired” to “pleasant/fresh.” Mean ratings for post-task PA were “cheerful/lively” to “delighted/energetic” (Figure 1)."

ALL_PANELS,"This pattern, summarized in Figure 7, indicates task-induced agentic emotion of positive and negative valence are not mutually exclusive and can co-occur in healthy individuals (Beebe-Center, 1965).Agentic traits
Exuberance and agentic anger responses were specifically predicted by participants’ trait SP, a measure of trait agency and reward sensitivity, and were – in contrast – wholly unrelated to multiple other traits present in the study participants, including traits of impulsivity, aggression, anxiety, affiliation, fear, and immersive emotion (Table 3 and Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,Our findings further suggest trait SP and inducibility of states of exuberance may provide novel markers for the capacity for agentic anger in young adults (Figure 7).
ALL_PANELS,"These data indicate a role of social leadership in agentic anger experience, and its psychometric independence from aggression, hostility, and intent to harm (Table 3 and Figure 7).Agentic behavior
Our preliminary findings indicate agentic anger and exuberance responses predicted the voluntary approach of risky rewards (‘active risk-taking’)."
ALL_PANELS,"Agentic anger and exuberance may thus facilitate voluntary approach (and engagement with) risky rewards (Figure 7) through different antecedent processes, with potential for differential follow-on effects."
ALL_PANELS,"These preliminary findings have relevance for motivation of personal and group action in pursuit of social justice: a timeless, difficult and uncertain goal that entails significant risk of harm for activists in a wide range of contexts (Friston, 2012; Bacchetti, 2013; Button et al., 2013; Quinlan, 2013).Future directions
Future work on agentic anger and other negatively valenced agentic states (Figure 7) will benefit from inclusion of additional measures such as courage, indignation, righteousness, rage, and moral injury, which were not evaluated in the present studies."
ALL_PANELS,"The findings may also have relevance to a fuller understanding of agency and anger in real-world contexts, such as Title VII employment discrimination and the legal system (see Carle, 2005, 2016).Summary and conclusions
In sum, the present studies provide two lines of preliminary proof-of-concept evidence for the agentic properties of anger and other negatively valenced states in healthy humans (Table 1 and Figure 7)."

ALL_PANELS,"Francucci et al. [13] have also observed such irreversible transverse cell wall deformation in compacted woven jute fabrics, and this phenomenon increased as the fibre content increased (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"This is in stark contrast with the observation of Lundquist et al. [40] (Figure 3), where all wood pulp lumen had collapsed by vf = 69%, and the wood pulp random mat was compressed further up to vf = 90%."
ALL_PANELS,Permeability can be experimentally measured by tracking the progression of the fluid flow front and monitoring the pressure field (Figure 5).
"c, d","However, a 2D radial flow achieved through central injection (Figure 5c,d) may be more appropriate for anisotropic reinforcements to quickly measure anisotropy in permeability."
5b,"The flow front can be tracked manually (e.g., with scale bars, as in Figure 5b), with a video camera, or through pressure sensors."
ALL_PANELS,"For a demonstration, Figure 6a shows the linear relationship between the square of the flow front position and the fill time for two separate infusion conditions; the slope of the curve x2/t is used as an input in Equation (3) to determine Kunsat.

ALL_PANELS,"Indeed, such concerns have been voiced in studies on the mould filling process of plant fibre reinforcements as well (Figure 7) [6,23,24,25]."
ALL_PANELS,"As Figure 8 highlights, at low flow velocities (and high fibre volume fractions) capillary flow dominates, leading to inter-yarn voids, while at high flow velocities (and low fibre volume fractions) viscous flow dominates, leading to intra-yarn voids."
ALL_PANELS,"Both effects have been shown for plant fibre composites (Figure 8) as a function of the fibre volume fraction [41,63]."
ALL_PANELS,This argument is further strengthened by the fact that the difference between the saturated and unsaturated permeability vanishes with increasing porosity (decreasing fibre volume fraction) (Figure 6).
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 2, plant fibre preforms experience all the compaction mechanisms that synthetic fibre preforms experience (described in Table 1), but not vice versa."

ALL_PANELS,"Follow-up analyses revealed that the complete alternation advantage was smaller in the four-choice PRC task, which controlled for signaling, than in the standard two-choice PRC task (e.g., the difference between the two points on the right side of Fig. 5c is smaller than the corresponding difference in Fig. 5a)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our second index of the complete alternation advantage related to color was also smaller in the four-choice (vs. two-choice) PRC task (e.g., for the mean z-RT data, the solid line in Fig. 5c has a shallower slope than the solid line in Fig. 5a)."

1a,"Protein Phosphatase 2A is a large family of Serine/Threonine phosphatases consisting of three main subunits—PP2A-A, PP2A-B, and PP2A-C—that form an active trimeric holoenzyme that dephosphorylates substrate proteins (Fig. 1A; refs."
3a,"Sensor, transducer, and effector proteins (from Fig. 3A schematic) were analyzed in OV81, PEO-1, and PEO-C42."
"f, g","Using similar rescue experiments as for 766, we demonstrated that SMAP-061–mediated effects were directly dependent on PP2A modulation (Fig. 5F and G)."
5h,"Calyculin-A rescues cell death by 40% at SMAP-061’s highest concentration (40 µmol/L), which alone leads to 100% cell death (Fig. 5H)."
5f,"We observed that for all three cell lines, SMAP-061 activity is effectively impaired by Calyculin-A preincubation, as observed by the cell death markers and RAD51 protein expression rescue (Fig. 5F)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our studies introduce a unique mechanism of synthetic lethality, through a small-molecule mediator of PP2A that potently reduces RAD51 expression, leading to concomitant apoptosis (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, further studies are necessary to assess the mechanism by which PP2A and SMAP-061 regulate RAD51 (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 1, the workflow started by collecting journal articles from June to August 2022, excluding irrelevant and incompletely published studies, and performing bibliometric analyses."
ALL_PANELS,"Research Framework
The research framework illustrates the analysis results based on scale, time, space, and composition. “Scale” includes descriptive and LDA analyses. “Time” refers to the analysis of the timeline of the 104 studies. “Space” refers to the distribution of research capacity analyzed by country. “Composition” refers to the network visualization analysis (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Figure 3, the earliest studies on intervention programs—“technological intervention,” “social support,” and “medical intervention”—emerged in 2014, based on analyses and screenings."
ALL_PANELS,"China had the highest research volume in terms of articles on smartphone addiction published in international academic journals, followed by South Korea, Taiwan, Spain, the UK, the US, India, Canada, Hong Kong, Iran, Australia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, the Caucasus region, France, the Hebrew region, Lebanon, Tunisia, the Philippines, Switzerland, Nigeria, Germany, Bangladesh, Oman, Sudan, Austria, Palestine, Vienna, Germany, Switzerland, Peru, and Brazil (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 5 illustrates the citation structure relationships among studies and indicates that the research of intervention programs for smartphone addiction is recognized by many academic journals and that they are interconnected in this field.
ALL_PANELS,"The visualization analysis depicted in Figure 5 shows clusters around lead researchers in the field, indicating that their research has a high degree of association with others."
ALL_PANELS,"The research framework illustrates the analysis results based on scale, time, space, and composition. “Scale” includes descriptive and LDA analyses. “Time” refers to the analysis of the timeline of the 104 studies. “Space” refers to the distribution of research capacity analyzed by country. “Composition” refers to the network visualization analysis (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 8 shows that certain keywords are intimately related to the intervention of smartphone addiction and represent related phenomena in that domain.
ALL_PANELS,Figure 1 illustrates this with a toy simulation of a set of studies testing a difference between means from two conditions.
ALL_PANELS,"When dealing with probabilistic phenomena, a Bayesian approach makes more sense, whereby we consider the accumulated evidence to determine the relative likelihood of one hypothesis over another (as illustrated in Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"About the same (that is, within 5% of each other)

Most people selected Option 3, whereas, as illustrated in Figure 3, Option 2 is the correct answer—with only 15 births per day, the day-to-day variation in the proportion of boys will be much higher than with 45 births per day, and hence, more days will have more than 60% boys."
ALL_PANELS,"Further evidence of the cumulative impact of citation bias is shown in Figure 4, which uses studies of intervention for depression."
ALL_PANELS,"Most people selected Option 3, whereas, as illustrated in Figure 3, Option 2 is the correct answer—with only 15 births per day, the day-to-day variation in the proportion of boys will be much higher than with 45 births per day, and hence, more days will have more than 60% boys."
ALL_PANELS,"Sources of uncertainty were identified systematically in all parts of the assessment, starting from the planning stage (step B in Figure 5 of EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018a)."
ALL_PANELS,"The analysis was divided into parts on three levels, corresponding to the structure of the hazard assessment, as illustrated in the upper part of Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"For each of the 21 clusters in the other HOCs, uncertainty was quantified by means of two quantitative expert judgements, comprising a third level of division in the uncertainty analysis, as illustrated in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"Assessment of clusters by expert judgement

The two questions for each cluster (see Figure 1) were assessed by expert judgement."
ALL_PANELS,"After a screening for the reliability and relevance of the results, six studies from four publications, all ranked as of limited relevance, were selected for further consideration (Figure 3 and Table 15)."
ALL_PANELS,The overview of the evaluation and the summary of the test results from the 22 studies are reported in Figure 4.
ALL_PANELS,The overview of the evaluation and the summary of the test results from the 21 studies are reported in Figure 5 and in Table 16.
ALL_PANELS,"The methods used to quantify the combined impact of the uncertainties affecting the hazard characterisation for HOCs other than genotoxicity are described in Section 2.3.4.1, in which an overview of the approach is provided in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"The cpfs for the 21 clusters were then combined to produce overall cpfs quantifying uncertainty about the estimated lowest BMD across all the 21 clusters, as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 in Section 2.3.4.1."
ALL_PANELS,"These revised judgements were used to produce revised overall cpfs quantifying uncertainty about the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters, which are shown in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,The horizontal axis of Figure 7 shows the range of doses in which the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters is considered to lie.
ALL_PANELS,Thus Figure 7 can be used to derive probabilities for the estimated lowest BMD across all 21 clusters being either above or below the RP.
ALL_PANELS,"The black dashed curves in Figure 7 are lower and upper bounds for the overall enveloped cpf, which reflect the combined effect of differences between experts in their judgements on each cluster."
ALL_PANELS,"The red solid curves in Figure 7 are lower and upper bounds for the overall averaged cpf, for which the cpfs of different experts for the same cluster are combined by averaging, giving equal weight to each expert."
ALL_PANELS,"The vertical blue dotted line in Figure 7 marks the dose corresponding to the RP (8.2 ng BPA/kg bw per day, expressed as HED) and the horizontal blue dotted lines show four estimates of the cumulative probability for this dose, i.e. the probability that the lowest BMD across all 21 clusters is below the RP."
ALL_PANELS,The results in Figure 7 are an estimate of the combined impact of those uncertainties which were considered by the experts when making judgements on each of the 21 clusters included in the preceding steps.
ALL_PANELS,"The outcome of this analysis is shown by the cumulative probability functions in Figure 7, which quantify uncertainty about the dose at which the lowest BMD across all clusters would lie if all the uncertainties were resolved, assessed by a structured process of expert judgement (EKE)."
ALL_PANELS,"Sensitivity analysis showed that the lowest part of the overall averaged cpf in Figure 7 (up to 5% probability on the vertical axis) was determined mainly by the cluster allergic lung inflammation and, in particular, by the study by O'Brien et al. (2014) [RefID 5462], reporting effects on production of pro‐inflammatory mediators and specific IgE in mice exposed prenatally to BPA."
ALL_PANELS,"Allergic lung inflammation was also the largest contributor to the middle part of the overall averaged cpf in Figure 7 (around 50% probability on the vertical axis), but here other clusters also contributed significantly (cellular immunity, inflammation and, to a lesser extent, male and female reproductive toxicity; see Figure D.13B in Appendix D)."
ALL_PANELS,"In the final step of the uncertainty analysis the CEP Panel assessed by expert judgement their probability that the lowest estimated BMD is below the RP, taking into account the estimates of this probability in Figure 7 and also additional uncertainties (Appendix D, Table D.5) that were not quantified earlier."
ALL_PANELS,"27


The cumulative probability functions in Figure 7 show the probability of the lowest estimated BMD being below each dose on the horizontal axis, based on the expert judgements made in the uncertainty analysis."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the lower and upper bounds for the averaged cpf in Figure 7, the probability of the lowest estimated BMD being below this dose would be between 43% and 57%, bracketing the 50% probability that would apply to a median estimate, as shown by the green solid lines in the figure."
ALL_PANELS,"Raw data for Figure 8, Panel E, could not be assessed as they were not included in the publicly available data set for the study."

"a, b, s","In general, the most frequently used journals did not have a disease-specific focus, though the most cited journal in the lung cancer dataset (Journal of Thoracic Oncology) and the two most cited in the leukemia dataset (Blood, Leukemia) are prominent publications focused on those diseases (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Tables 1,2)."
"a, b, s","While general interest journals were cited often (e.g., New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Science), publications that have a focus more specifically on cancer genetics were also frequently cited (e.g., Oncotarget, Oncogene) (Fig. 1a, b, Supplemental Tables 1,2)."
1c,"While Oncology journals were the most commonly used category, many basic science and medical specialty categories were represented (Fig. 1c)."
1d,"The publishers: Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and the American Chemical Society – accounted for 59% of the journals in our clinical interpretation dataset (Fig. 1d)."
1e,50 out of 265 journals (19%) were classified as Gold Open Access and 25% (66/265) had Delayed Open Access policies (Fig. 1e).
1f,"Among publishers with more than 5 journals in the dataset, we found that the proportion of Gold or Delayed Open Access journals was markedly lower for large for-profit publishers than for the remainder of the dataset as a whole (Fig. 1f)."
"a, b","The collections of all six universities provided almost complete access, with all collections providing access to near or greater than 90% of journals in the dataset (Fig 2a, b)."
2a,Coverage rates were high both for the journals used in lung cancer cases and the journals used in leukemia cases (Fig. 2a).
2b,"Coverage rate was also similarly high when subscription coverage was measured in terms of number of uses from the subscribed journals rather than number of journals used, indicating that university collections did not have coverage gaps in journals that are of high value for genomics (Fig. 2b)."
2a,"As with university collections, no difference was seen in the coverage of the journals needed for lung cancer and leukemia interpretation (Fig. 2a)."
2b,We observed that coverage was somewhat higher in hospital system collections when measured by articles used from the subscribed journals than when measured by number of journals (Fig. 2b).
2c,"We found that the ratio of articles covered to journals covered was much higher for institutions with smaller subscription holdings (Fig. 2c), indicating that their collections are focused on publications with more general use."
2d,"Similarly, the average impact factor of journals in smaller holdings was also much higher, indicating a focus on general interest journals (Fig. 2d)."
3a,"To assess the gaps in university holdings, we analyzed WOS categories for the journals in the clinical interpretation dataset that were missing from university collections (Fig. 3a)."
3b,When we examined the distribution of WOS categories in hospital collections we found that the distribution of categories roughly reflected the dataset as a whole (Fig. 3b).
ALL_PANELS,"Journals without a WOS category were not well-represented in the hospital collections (Fig. 3b), and WOS categories of journals in the clinical genomics dataset did not vary greatly between institutions, further indicating that hospital collections do not appear to be greatly specialized (Fig. 3b)."

What works for whom and in what circumstances in relation to practitioners supporting people living with and beyond cancer to self-manage the long-term physical and psychosocial consequences on completing systemic anticancer therapies?
Pawson et al have proposed a method for conducting realist reviews.21 However, there is freedom to interpret the method and customise the steps.22 26 29 This review is guided by five steps, adapted from Pawson et al for conducting a realist review: (1) define the review scope, (2) develop initial programme theories, (3) search for evidence, (4) select and appraise evidence and (5) extract and synthesise data.21

ALL_PANELS,"Thus, Older Children and Adults adapted exploration to time horizons by exploring less under Short Horizons, whereas Younger Children maintained relatively higher levels of exploration and therefore adapted less (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Older Children did not exhibit this relationship (p=.42), likely due to their high overall levels of adaptive exploration (Figure 4)."

"a, w","In the case of Figure 1A, when ARS is dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte solution and purged with argon, the pH was measured to be 5, and the ARS exhibited a two‐electron reduction and oxidation that occur in two separate steps."
ALL_PANELS,The DAC absorption and desorption cycling results are shown in Figure 2 along with the humidity and temperature conditions.
ALL_PANELS,"Critically, due to the nature of the CO2 capture mechanism, the system can operate in very humid conditions, which is a considerable hurdle for many temperature‐swing DAC systems.
[25]
 As seen in Figure 2, the capture and release of CO2 was highly repeatable over more than 72 hours of continuous testing."
ALL_PANELS,"Coulombic efficiency was calculated for each cycle based on the amount of charge passed during the charge cycle (sorption) divided by the amount of charged passed during the discharge cycle (desorption).
[26]
 Alternatively, capacity retention is defined as the amount of charge passed on the discharge cycle of cycle n relative to the amount of charge passed on the discharge cycle of n+1.
[26]
 From the charge/discharge voltage curves in Figure 3, it is evident that, much like the CO2 capture experiments, the charging and discharging of the system are highly repeatable without much deviation."
ALL_PANELS,"Given the high coulombic efficiency and capacity retention metrics exhibited during CO2 capture testing, we attempted to replicate the experiment in longer term electrochemical cycling measurements, as shown in Figure 4."
5a,Initial CFD simulations of the unmodified flow field (Figure 5A) showed that the solution′s velocity vectors linearly followed the path of the flow field with minimal mixing along the z‐axis.
5a,The most turbulent portions of the unmodified flow field were at the end of each linear section (Figure 5A).
5b,"In these areas, solution would flow up or down the triangular ramp, hit the middle agitator and cause circular solution mixing (Figure 5B)."

ALL_PANELS,Videos are followed by a valence rating (indicating empathic affect sharing) and by either a question regarding the narrators mental state (for videos with ToM demand) or a factual reasoning control question (for videos without ToM demand) (see Fig. 4).
2a,"We observed a strong negative correlation between valence ratings and prosocial decisions following emotional videos (ρ = -0.62, p < 0.001), indicating that stronger experience of shared negative affect was associated with increased helping behavior (Fig. 2A)."

Employing a validated and naturalistic video-based assessment of empathy and mentalizing, we show that inducing empathy leads to a strong and reliable increase of prosocial decisions."
ALL_PANELS,"In this task (see Fig. 4), participants were presented with a short video-clip (~ 15 s.) in which a female or male narrator either told a neutral (e.g., selling items on eBay) or emotionally negative (e.g., one’s sister suffering from bowel cancer), allegedly autobiographical story that either does or does not impose ToM demand."

ALL_PANELS,"There was a moderate and statistically significant positive correlation between year of publication and citation density (r = 0.625; P < .001), and little correlation with no statistical significance was found between year of publication and raw citation count (r = 0.241; P = .10) (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"All articles were published between 1975 and 2013 (Figure 3), with most of the articles being published between 2000 to 2010 (n = 25 articles) and 1990 to 1999 (15 articles)."

ALL_PANELS,"The HUC 8 highlighted in red in panel a is depicted in Figure 3.The inherent nestedness of the dataset can be used to examine the spatial pattern of confluence conditions across a range of spatial scales, from the spatial pattern for HUC 8 units across the country (Figure 2) to HUC 12 units nested in HUC 8 units (Figure 3b) to individual confluences within HUC 12 units (Figure 3a)."
ALL_PANELS,"There was often considerable spatial variability in confluences conditions within the HUC 12 units that comprise a HUC 8 (e.g., Figures 2a vs. 3b) and there was often considerable spatial variability in confluence conditions within the HUC 12 units themselves (e.g., Figure 3a vs. 3b)."
3a,"The scale of individual confluences is often the scale at which restoration occurs because of cost factors (Wickham, Riitters, et al. 2017) and an interesting example of how the data could be used to support local ecological restoration efforts is represented by the confluence encircled in black in Figure 3a."
ALL_PANELS,"The Google Earth™ image date is February 2, 2019.Across the conterminous U.S., about 20% (n = 196,818) of the confluences were hydraulically significant, and their distribution across the clusters was uneven (Figure 4)."
3a,"Depending on the objectives, our emphasis on generality may or may not impact the use of these data at local scales (e.g., Figure 3a)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our results for hydrologic significance for stream orders greater than one (i.e., Figure 4) could also be affected if the inclusion of headwaters changed the spatial pattern of stream orders."
ALL_PANELS,"The inherent nestedness of the dataset can be used to examine the spatial pattern of confluence conditions across a range of spatial scales, from the spatial pattern for HUC 8 units across the country (Figure 2) to HUC 12 units nested in HUC 8 units (Figure 3b) to individual confluences within HUC 12 units (Figure 3a)."

1a,"VDR protein levels were detected in all cells, and generally were elevated following 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment, which was most pronounced in nonmalignant AA RC43N cells; RC77T cells did not change VDR expression in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1A)."
1b,"In RC43T compared with LNCaP, the basal VDR was enriched for the TF, SAFB2 and following 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment there was a gain of the NFκB CoR PPP1R13L, TRIM29 and TGFB1, and loss of PARP1 (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2)."
1c,"Next, we identified those differentially enriched proteins that were altered the most depending on genomic ancestry and oncogenic transformation (Fig. 1C)."
"a, l","The greatest 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent impact on NF and mononucleosome (mono) regions was in RC43N and RC43T (Fig. 2A, left, right)."
3b,Others nuclear receptor motifs such as NR4A1/NUR77 and PGR were common (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S6).
3c,"Again, delta enrichment values (Fig. 3C) revealed that 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment reduced motif enrichment in LNCaP, RC43N, and RC43T cells suggesting that VDR binding sites became more exclusive."
1b,"The 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent NF regions in RC43T annotated to multiple proteins that were enriched in the basal VDR complex (logPV = 26.8) including VDR and XRCC5 and given that these represent loss of NF regions it may reflect why the number of proteins in the 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated VDR complex in RC43T is much reduced compared with the basal state (Fig. 1B)."
5a,"This identified 27 altered coregulators in AA patients, and from these, five were uniquely or more significantly altered in AA compared with EA TMPRSS2 fusion negative prostate cancer (Fig. 5A)."
1a,"B, The blot used for Fig. 1A (cells treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (100 nmol/L, 24 hours) or vehicle control and total protein isolated) was stripped and reprobed with antibodies toward BAZ1A and SMARCA5."
1c,"Finally, we used partial correlation analyses to define how genomic ancestry and oncogenic transformation enriched components of the VDR complex (Fig. 1C) impacted the strength of the correlations between VDR and AA VDR ChIP-seq annotated genes in AA tumors, or EA VDR ChIP-seq annotated genes in EA tumors."

ALL_PANELS,The largest increase to the value of an individual catchment was 0.1678 and the largest increase to an individual watershed was 0.2647 (see Figure 3).
ALL_PANELS,Areas incurring the greatest stress were in the rapidly developing Wasilla-Palmer core area (Figure 2).
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the ICI scores for catchments along the largely unpaved and unpopulated Denali Highway had some of the largest increases (Figure 3: Ac)."
ALL_PANELS,Culvert remediation in watersheds with relatively high integrity also impacted the IWI scores downstream from the culvert (compare the Petersville Road in Figure 3: Bc and Bw).
ALL_PANELS,"For developed areas with high concentrations of culverts and other stressors, we found that the impact of remediation on the catchment ICI scores (Figure 3: Cc) was negligible compared with the change to the IWI scores downstream (Figure 3: Cw)."

ALL_PANELS,"Subsequently, two rounds of exercises were attempted, in some cases revealing unanticipated disagreements in the computational calculations presented by the participants (see figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Recommendations for code development
In the following we provide some practical recommendations (see figure 7) for developing research software that is open and adheres to FAIR principles [141, 142]."
ALL_PANELS,"Here we classify data into two general types, experimental and computational, and in three general forms, raw, processed (or analyzed) and a third category we term extracted data, as shown in figure 8."
ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, raw charge-voltage data used to produce a Lissajous plot may be smoothed by a filter, as illustrated in figure 9."
ALL_PANELS,"There has been a noticeable trend in the graphical presentation of data to move away from simpler x–y scatter plots, which show single points with error bars (or confidence internals) that are often not well-defined and ambiguously open to interpretation, to scatter plots that include the raw data with the statistical information overlaid [174]. (See, for example, figure 10.) In the physical sciences, concerns often arise based on how extracted quantities are determined and presented, where inconsistencies within a field make it difficult to both assess the validity of the claims in the paper and to compare to prior literature."
ALL_PANELS,"For this application, treatment is characterized by the J cm−2 delivered to the surface [203, 204] although the range of operating conditions for which this dose-driven description applies is limited. (See figure 11.) Characterizing treatment of polymers by J cm−2 is typically done for atmospheric pressure plasma treatment in a specified ambient—for example, air or He."

ALL_PANELS,"The exceptions were two projects that scored a 1 for Discoverable, and two other projects that had an element score of 1 for either Transparent or Actionable (Table 2; Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"DATA scores for the 104 articles that we scored ranged from 0 (the minimum score) to 8 (the maximum score), though the distribution of scores was heavily skewed towards low values with 55 journal articles scoring zero (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Open in a new tabElement-wise DATA scores were primarily clustered around zero, as expected given the overall DATA score distribution, with slightly more than half of Discoverable and Accessible scores and about 60% of Transparent and Actionable scores ranking zero (Fig 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Unlike the broad distribution that we observed in the DATA scores associated with journal articles (Fig 3), which indicates variable levels of data sharing effectiveness, we found that project-level datasets were either not shared (DATA = 0; 76% of projects) or were shared fairly effectively (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Element-wise DATA scores were primarily clustered around zero, as expected given the overall DATA score distribution, with slightly more than half of Discoverable and Accessible scores and about 60% of Transparent and Actionable scores ranking zero (Fig 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"The BCG model divides the condition gradient into 6 levels of biological condition, from (1) undisturbed to (6) highly disturbed (Fig. 1; Davies and Jackson, 2006; USEPA, 2016b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig. 1 shows the conceptual BCG model which describes incremental biological changes along a gradient of anthropogenic stressors, in which the IWI and ICI represent a generalized landscape integrity gradient."
ALL_PANELS,"In a 2D scatterplot, we can relate the IWI and ICI with estimates of biological condition, represented by synthetic data, to illustrate how site-scale biological condition data could be combined with multiscale landscape integrity data to inform management decisions on appropriate actions to protect or restore stream habitat (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Watershed- and catchment-scale indicators can either be plotted on a scale of integrity (as shown here), or on a scale of stressors which would be plotted as 1 minus the index value (e.g., 1 – IWI value) so that high stressors are at the origin, and low stressors are associated with the upper right quadrant.The four quadrants in Fig. 2 were obtained by drawing two perpendicular lines positioned at the 0.5 value of each integrity index."
ALL_PANELS,"As a further example of the utility of this framework, we provide examples of how multiscale landscape integrity data, when visualized in a map, could provide managers with a powerful tool for identifying sites that meet certain protection and restoration criteria (Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Such a map could allow managers to easily identify priority areas for protection, i.e., those with high IWI and high ICI values (represented by blue catchments), and areas for restoration, i.e., high IWI and low ICI values (green catchments, Fig. 3)."

ALL_PANELS,"The 3D scatterplot in Fig. 4 relates the biological condition of streams to three landscape integrity gradients: watershed, catchment and stream-reach scale."
ALL_PANELS,"Similar to the map in Fig. 3, a landscape integrity map displaying catchments according to the level (high or low) of watershed, catchment, and stream-reach scale integrity could be highly valuable for prioritizing areas for protection and restoration."

ALL_PANELS,"In contrast with integrative genomics, systems genetics aims to identify the major (genetic) determinants of disease and complex traits explicitly through the modeling and analysis of biological networks (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"We queried the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) literature database, PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), to retrieve ‘integrative genomics’ and ‘systems genetics’ publications, and our search highlighted the growing use of these strategies in biomedical research in recent years (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although humans are the predominant ‘model organism’ of choice, the earliest systems genetics studies (from 2007 and onwards) were primarily carried out in rodents (particularly in mice; Fig. 2)."

In this section we present a summary of systems genetics analyses in the rat, with a focus on those studies where both master genetic regulators and genetic networks underlying complex disease have been identified and translated to humans (Table 2 and Fig. 4)."
"b, t","Right: trans-eQTL networks identified in the rat were conserved to humans and enriched for GWAS variants, therefore linking the networks to a whole-body disease phenotype (i.e. type 1 diabetes) (Heinig et al., 2010) (see Table 2).The first integrated systems genetics study was performed in the rat and the results were translated to humans (Heinig et al., 2010) (Fig. 4B, Table 2)."

ALL_PANELS,"The initial rates of •OH reaction with RhB, H2O2, and silica or alumina were contrasted to assess the relative fate of •OH (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"In this analysis, conditions and parameter values were assumed and included an ideal representative volume of unconsolidated porous media (1 m3), 1 pore volume mixture of trichloroethylene (TCE) (10 mg/L) and H2O2 (10 g/L) with instantaneous mixing, no TCE sorption, and [•OH]SS = 5 × 10−16 mol/L (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"The rate of •OH reaction with solid surfaces (t = 0 h) dominated the fate of •OH by several orders of magnitude, relative to TCE and H2O2 in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Conversely, in our study, •OH reaction was dominated by surface scavenging at 10–50 g/L silica, alumina, or MMT, in both Fe-AHP and UV-AHP systems (Fig. 1), and even greater •OH scavenging was projected under unconsolidated porous media conditions (Fig. 2)."

ALL_PANELS,"However, in the survey data currently available, students expressed a preference for the blended approach over the largely synchronous approach (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Examining accompanying student survey comments, the accepted benefits of flexibility, convenience, and ability to personalize learning were frequently noted.2,12 For example, “I can choose my own time to study;” “the time is flexible;” “narrated videos give me more freedom…if I miss some points, I can pause and watch that part of the video again;” “I can repeat the points which I didn’t get and skip the parts I know.”

ALL_PANELS,"The Leader Intron Increased GmScreamM8 (Soybean eEF1A) Promoter Activity
To evaluate the effect of the GmScreamM8 leader intron on the high activity of the GmScreamM8 promoter, intron deletion and translocation constructs were generated and validated using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons and stable expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1)."
1b,"The intron-containing GmScreamM8 promoter construct gave much higher transient GFP expression, compared to the intron-less GmSM8ni promoter construct (Fig 1b)."
1b,"Translocation of the intron sequence upstream of the pre-intronic sequence of the GmScreamM8 promoter in both sense (GmSM8InfP) and antisense (GmSM8InrP) orientations yielded lower levels of transient expression compared with the GmScreamM8 promoter, with somewhat higher expression from the upstream placement of the intron in the sense orientation (Fig 1b)."
1c,Stably-transformed soybean hairy root events from the intron-less (GmSM8ni) and intron translocation constructs (GmSM8InfP; GmSM8InrP) all showed similar expression levels that were not significantly different from each other (Fig 1c).
1c,"The GmScreamM8 promoter, with the full intron in its native position, gave the highest expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1c)."
1c,"The expression patterns were the same for all hairy roots, as all roots displayed higher expression in the root elongation zone and root tips (Fig 1c)."
ALL_PANELS,"To further dissect the intronic sequences that enhanced gene expression, the full-length native promoter was evaluated with four intron internal deletions (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Three of the four intron internal deletion constructs (Fig 2a), GmSM8InD2, GmSM8InD3, and GmSM8InD4, gave rise to a level of transient GFP expression lower than the full intron-containing GmScreamM8 promoter but higher than the intron-less construct GmSM8ni (Fig 2b)."
2c,"In stably transformed soybean hairy roots, the three deletion constructs drove levels of GFP expression significantly lower than the GmScreamM8 promoter but higher than GmSM8ni (Fig 2c)."
ALL_PANELS,"Another large intron deletion construct, GmSM8InD1, in which the majority of the intron sequence (parts 2, 3, and 4) was removed, displayed very weak but detectable activity in both transient and stable expression analyses (Fig 2)."
"d, l","Reverse transcription PCR revealed that intron splicing took place with all the constructs except GmSM8InD1, where the intron was not processed, leading to a larger amplicon (Fig 2d, left)."
ALL_PANELS,"This was further confirmed by sequencing.The Leader Intron Enhanced the Activity of Proximal Promoter Elements
To simplify the identification of the intronic sequence that contributed to high gene expression, a synthetic promoter consisting of an element tetramer and a core promoter was developed (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Different combinations of the EF4 tetramer from GmScreamM1 with the 35S core or GmScreamM8 core promoter, with and without the GmScreamM8 intron, showed that the tetramer with the GmScreamM8 core and GmScreamM8 intron gave the highest activity (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,This high activity was observed using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons (Fig 3b) and stable expression in transgenic soybean hairy roots (Fig 3c).
3b,Another intron-containing construct (4xEF4-35Score-M8Intron) with the 35S core promoter rather than the GmScreamM8 core promoter also displayed significantly enhanced gene expression in comparison with its intron-less counterpart (4xEF4-35Score) (Fig 3b).
3b,"However, use of the leader intron did not show any enhancement of gene expression when it was cloned downstream of the 35S core promoter without the EF4 tetramer (Fig 3b)."
3c,"In transformed soybean hairy roots, the 4xEF4-M8C construct showed the highest expression among all the element-intron variants (Fig 3c), similar to what was seen using transient expression analysis."
3c,Intron-containing constructs (4xEF4-35Score-M8Intron; 4xEF4-M8C) drove significantly higher GFP expression than the counterparts without the intron (4xEF4-35Score; 4xEF4-M8Core) and the constructs containing only a core promoter and the intron but without the regulatory element tetramer (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C) (Fig 3c).
3c,"For core promoters (35Score or GmSM8Core), the intensity of GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots was significantly increased by 2–4 fold if the EF4 tetramer was present upstream (Fig 3c)."
ALL_PANELS,"However, use of either core promoter (35Score or GmSM8Core) without the EF4 tetramer, and either with or without the intron (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C), resulted in low but still detectable expression levels (Fig 3c).Deletion of a 222 bp Intron Internal Sequence Led to Reduced Activity
Using transient expression analysis of constructs containing the EF4 tetramer, the GmScreamM8 core, and three different intron deletions, reduced expression was obtained only when part 3 of the intron (4xEF4-M8CInD3; Fig 4a) was deleted, while deletion of part 2 (4xEF4-M8CInD2) or part 4 (4xEF4-M8CInD4) did not significantly influence the intensity of gene expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8C, which possessed a full intron (Fig 4b)."
4c,"For the other deletion constructs, 4xEF4-M8CInD2 displayed a significant lower activity than the control 4xEF4-M8C, while 4xEF4-M8CInD4 did not show a significant difference (Fig 4c)."
ALL_PANELS,"Analysis of three additional intron variants (Fig 5a), where intron parts 2, 3, and 4 were individually evaluated, revealed that the 4xEF4-M8CIN3 gave two-fold higher GFP transient expression than the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (same to 4xEF4-M8C with addition of two restriction sites; see Materials and Methods), which possessed the intact intron (Fig 5b)."
5c,"In stably-transformed hairy roots, 4xEF4-M8CIN3 showed comparable activity to 4xEF4-M8CIN234, and significantly higher expression than 4xEF4-M8CIN2 and 4xEF4-M8CIN4 (Fig 5c)."
ALL_PANELS,Further analysis of intron variants (Fig 6a) revealed that the monomeric and the trimeric repeat of the 222 bp intronic sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3; 4xEF4-M8CIN333) gave approximately two-fold higher expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 using transient expression analysis (Fig 6b).
6b,"Another intron variant 4xEF4-M8CIN234234, showed 1.5X higher expression than 4xEF4-M8CIN234, but still lower than 4xEF4-M8CIN3 (Fig 6b)."
6c,"For stable expression in soybean hairy roots, the stuffed intron (4xEF4-M8CIN23334) showed the highest expression compared to other intron variants, and a significant difference was observed between the stuffed intron and the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (Fig 6c)."
7a,"Overlapping columns show no significant differences between constructs by the t test (LSD) at p<0.05.DNA sequencing revealed that the 222 bp intronic sequence mainly contained an array of two and a half short imperfect repeats, in lengths of 60 bp, 60 bp, and 30 bp (Fig 7a and 7b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Deletion of the whole repeated sequence within the intron (4xEF4-M8CIN3D1) led to 50% decrease of GFP expression in transient expression as well as a significant decrease in GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots, while retention of the first 60 bp repeat sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3D2) did not restore the activity of the whole repeated sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3), as evaluated using both transient and stable expression (Fig 7c and 7d).Discussion
Transient Expression
Use of the automated image collection and analysis system with GFP allowed for continual monitoring of promoter activity over 100 h (Figs 1–7), generating consistent results for measurement of promoter strength."
ALL_PANELS,"This approach has been useful for quantification of the effects of promoters [39], intron-variants [26] and cis-regulatory elements [38], and seems to be useful for evaluation of the promoter and intron variants described in this research.Stable Expression in Hairy Roots
Promoter-mediated gene expression levels in stably transformed soybean hairy roots were largely reflective of the levels obtained using transient expression analysis (Figs 1–5 and 7), with slight inconsistency across systems in certain instances (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although use of hairy roots for promoter analysis does have some limitations, evaluation of gene expression in stably transformed soybean hairy roots can be a good general indicator of promoter strength in whole transgenic plants [26, 34, 38].Intron-Mediated Enhancement
Removal of the leader intron from the original GmScreamM8 promoter (GmSM8ni, Fig 1) resulted in 60% decrease in gene expression, suggesting that the leader intron significantly contributed to the high activity of the ~1.5 kb promoter (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Introduction of intron translocation constructs (GmSM8InfP and GmSM8InrP) (Fig 1) did not lead to high GFP expression, suggesting that the GmScreamM8 leader intron did not contain classical enhancers that could increase gene expression independent of the position and orientation."
ALL_PANELS,"Partial deletion of intronic regions (part 2, part 3, part 4) in GmScreamM8 did not completely abolish intron enhancement of gene expression (Fig 2), but resulted in different levels of reduction in expression, indicating a redundancy of IME signals, which is common with this type of intron [55], possibly due to the interactions of intronic regulatory sequences throughout the GmScreamM8 intron and the multiple proximal promoter regulatory motifs."
ALL_PANELS,Analysis of intron partial deletion constructs with the full-length promoter showed that the partial deletions reduced promoter activity (Fig 2).
ALL_PANELS,"The largest intron deletion construct GmSM8InD1 (Fig 2), with only a 68 bp intron sequence remaining, showed very low but detectable GFP expression in both transient and stable expression assays."
ALL_PANELS,"Although the 35S core has been widely used for evaluation of cis-regulatory elements due to its low background expression and efficient transcriptional initiation [61], the GmScreamM8 core was more efficient than the 35S core for intron sequence evaluation, as the leader intron exhibited a larger gene enhancement with the GmScreamM8 core compared to the 35S core using our transient and stable expression assays, with or without the element tetramer upstream of core promoters (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"With synthetic introns, intron sequences of interest can be evaluated by manipulating the copy number and sequences of intron regions (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"These types of intron variants, in addition to the intron translocation constructs (Fig 1) and the partial internal deletion constructs (Figs 4, 5 and 7), can be very useful for identifying intron components that contribute to increased gene expression."
ALL_PANELS,"Further truncation of the repeated sequence within the intron led to dramatic reductions in GFP expression (Fig 7), indicating that the whole repeated sequence contributed to high levels of gene expression."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, a TAGATC was found in the three imperfect repeated sequences of our GmScreamM8 leader intron (Fig 7)."

7c,"Deletion of the whole repeated sequence within the intron (4xEF4-M8CIN3D1) led to 50% decrease of GFP expression in transient expression as well as a significant decrease in GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots, while retention of the first 60 bp repeat sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3D2) did not restore the activity of the whole repeated sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3), as evaluated using both transient and stable expression (Fig 7c and 7d)."

To simplify the identification of the intronic sequence that contributed to high gene expression, a synthetic promoter consisting of an element tetramer and a core promoter was developed (Fig 3)."
3c,"However, use of either core promoter (35Score or GmSM8Core) without the EF4 tetramer, and either with or without the intron (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C), resulted in low but still detectable expression levels (Fig 3c)."

3b,"Non-adaptive response to stress (Fig. 3b)
i.As relevant to police contexts, ANS over or under activation results in a variety of detriments, including cognitive, sensory and perceptual narrowing that may hinder performance during field duties (e.g., poor motor control, reduced situational awareness, learning and memory) (Anderson et al., 2019; Baldwin et al., 2022; Di Nota & Huhta, 2019)."
3c,"Describe that there are no exact HR values that directly lead to adaptive versus non-adaptive performance, but rather, research has demonstrated general zones of effectiveness (Fig. 3c)."
ALL_PANELS,"The first technique instructed in our protocol is the ‘Reset Breath.’ Similar to a physiological sigh (Vlemincx et al., 2013), the Reset Breath stimulates the vagus nerve and signals the brain (see Fig. 1) to provide a short window during which the officer can shift attention from the unease that accompanies the stress response and refocus on the task at hand (Arpaia & Andersen, 2019; Bennell et al., 2021; Laborde et al., 2018; Vlemincx et al., 2013; Zelano et al., 2016)."
ALL_PANELS,"To demonstrate the Reset Breath in action, show the sample HRVB screen trace (Fig. 4) and describe the following:

ALL_PANELS,"This will allow you to Refocus your attention on what’s important now, broaden your situational awareness, and enable more effective Responding through better decision-making and motor control.”
As a major practical component of RRR training we have officers partner up and practice the Reset Breath while assuming a grounded position, often called the interview stance in policing (Fig. 5) for approximately 3 min (at least two Reset Breaths per partner)."
ALL_PANELS,"A grounded state is in line with the interview stance, a body position that enhances safety and readiness for optimal physical action (see Fig. 5)."
3c,"Specifically, instructors can intervene if they observe that officers are at risk of becoming physiologically overactivated (Fig. 3c) or confirm that officers are applying the RRR technique effectively based on the HRVB trace."
ALL_PANELS,"Return to the home screen and confirm that your real-time HR is visible moving across the screen, displayed as purple dots (see Fig. 4 for screen view)."
ALL_PANELS,"Before the first scenario begins, the instructor or an additional facilitator will begin recording the officer using the video function on the HRV Trace app, which superimposes the real-time HRVB trace (Fig. 6)."

i.At the start and stop commands, the facilitator will pull an event marker in the HRV Trace app to manually mark the HRVB data (Fig. 7c)."

ALL_PANELS,"To demonstrate this, we show officers Fig. 7 to contrast resting HR (panel a) from HR during Recovery Breathing (panel b), during which vagal tone is promoted and physiological recovery occurs.

“Every person has a breathing rate which will maximize their optimal level of activation to maintain effectiveness, and this can be seen in the HRVB trace."
8a,"In a group setting, seven different paces (7.2, 6.8, 6.4, 6.0, 5.6, 5.2) are practiced for two minutes each using the ‘training’ setting in the HRV Trace app (Fig. 8a)."

"a, t","In one set of experiments, dFISH was performed using dual riboprobes to detect both the plus and the minus strands of SmedTV, designed to nonoverlapping regions of the viral genome (Fig. 3A, top row)."
3a,"Within confocal sections through the worm (region of head shown in Fig. 3A), SmedTV RNA was detected in only a subset of discrete cells, and both strands consistently colocalized within these cells (101/101 SmedTV-staining cells that we counted)."
"a, m","Interestingly, colocalization of the two strands of SmedTV RNA was most readily evident in cell nuclei, also colocalizing with the nuclear counterstain (Fig. 3A, middle row)."
ALL_PANELS,"Consistent with this finding, few SmedTV-staining cells were detected by dFISH among piwi-1-expressing stem cells (30) in confocal sections through stem cell-rich regions of worm trunks (Fig. 3C, green and magenta, respectively); moreover, the few SmedTV-staining cells that were seen in these regions appear not to express piwi-1 (Fig. 3C)."
3d,"Two single-cell RNA-seq data sets previously reported from different labs (BioProjects PRJNA276084 and PRJNA317292) (31, 32) supported the observation that fewer sequence reads from SmedTV were found in X1 stem cells and other neoblasts than in differentiated tissues, particularly neural cell types (Fig. 3D)."
3e,"By reexamining these data, we found that 22 of 25 cells with the highest levels of sequence reads from SmedTV (average log fold change [avg_logFC] values > 3.5) mapped to previously defined cell type clusters representing the neural class (33) (Fig. 3E)."
3e,"Expanding to examine the top 100 cells for SmedTV (avg_logFC values > 2.5), we found that 56 cells mapped to the neural class, with the other 44 cells distributed among seven other tissue classes: cathepsin+ (12 cells), protonephridia (8 cells), epidermis (6 cells), muscle (5 cells), parenchyma (5 cells), intestine (4 cells), and neoblasts (4 cells) (Fig. 3E)."
3f,This was indicated by differences in marker gene expression (log2 [number of reads/transcript]) as illustrated using a heat map (Fig. 3F).
"a, r","To address this question, we performed WISH to identify SmedTV-staining cells in GFP(RNAi) (i.e., control) worms versus worms that underwent triple knockdown of piwi-1, -2, and -3 (30, 35) by RNAi (efficiency of knockdowns described here and below confirmed by quantitative PCR [qPCR] [Fig. 4A, right])."
"a, t","We observed no discernible changes in the apparent numbers or distributions of SmedTV-staining cells in any of these piwi-1,2,3(RNAi) worms by WISH or when quantified by qPCR (Fig. 4A, top)."
"a, b","Reciprocally, similar results were obtained upon ablation of stem cells by ionizing irradiation (Fig. 4A, bottom right)."
4b,"Again, however, we observed no discernible changes in the apparent numbers or distributions of SmedTV-staining cells in the RIG-I(RNAi) worms versus control(RNAi) worms examined by WISH or when quantified by qPCR (Fig. 4B)."
4c,"To address this possibility, we combined FISH and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (40) to determine whether cells undergoing apoptosis might correspond to those that stain for SmedTV (Fig. 4C)."
5a,"Heads and tails were amputated from worms, and the remaining trunk fragments were fixed at various time points (1, 3, 7, 9, and 14 days) postamputation (pa) (Fig. 5A)."
"a, s","Interestingly, WISH demonstrated very few, if any, cells staining for SmedTV in either the head or the tail blastemas (newly regenerated tissue) until 7 dpa (Fig. 5A, second from right)."
"a, f","By 9 dpa, strongly SmedTV-staining cells were more generally found in the regenerated head tissue, with further increases evident by 14 dpa, including in the eyespots (Fig. 5A, far right)."
2a,"The tricladiviruses show more distant, yet evident, phylogenetic relationships to Totiviridae family member GLV and other toti-like viruses, such as LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, that have been tentatively assigned to family Totiviridae (see Fig. 2A), and we therefore find it sensible at this point to identify the tricladiviruses also as tentative members of family Totiviridae.Proteins."
ALL_PANELS,"The tricladiviruses, like some other toti-like viruses, instead have three long ORFs in their genomic plus strands, but including two ORFs that overlap and have the same coding capacities for an apparent CP (P1) and RdRp (P2) as just described (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Among the related viruses shown in Fig. 2A, nonenveloped virus particles with isometric capsids have also been shown for Camponotus yamaokai virus (CyV), GLV, and LbTV (20, 22, 23, 42), and none of the other viruses in Fig. 2A have been suggested to lack such capsids."
2a,"As only CP and RdRp are essential for totivirus replication (most viruses in Fig. 2A have ORFs for only these two proteins), some auxiliary role for P0 seems possible or even likely."
ALL_PANELS,These cells appear to be concentrated in neural structures but are scattered through other worm tissues as well (Fig. 3).
ALL_PANELS,"In this light, we propose that SmedTV is transmitted to progeny worms by most or all cells in each manually divided fragment of the mother, including stem cells and others in which SmedTV replication/expression has been repressed to lower levels (Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"As tissue regeneration proceeds in the progeny worms, SmedTV replication/expression is then derepressed along certain differentiating cell lineages, including some photoreceptors and other neurons (Fig. 6) but cells in other tissues as well (Fig. 3)."
2a,"Related viruses in Fig. 2A for which evidence of vertical transmission during sexual reproduction has been obtained are CyV and LbTV (20, 42).Nuclear localization."
2a,Evidence in this report for the presence of both strands of SmedTV RNA in the nuclei of planarian cells is thus consistent with these findings for GLV and also consistent with the fact that GLV and the tricladiviruses share a relatively close phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 2A).
2a,"The tricladiviruses show more distant, yet evident, phylogenetic relationships to Totiviridae family member GLV and other toti-like viruses, such as LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, that have been tentatively assigned to family Totiviridae (see Fig. 2A), and we therefore find it sensible at this point to identify the tricladiviruses also as tentative members of family Totiviridae."

ALL_PANELS,Riboprobes for SmedTV were prepared from two pPR-T4P plasmids into which a region of sequence from either end of the SmedTV genome had been cloned (nt positions 510 to 2094 [region 1] or nt positions 6318 to 7874 [region 2]; position numbers based on the SmedTV plus-strand consensus sequence represented in Fig. 1).
"a, t","For the colocalization analysis of SmedTV RNA in Fig. 3A, the respective riboprobes were designed to hybridize either to a 3′-proximal region of the genomic plus strand (minus-strand probe transcribed from cloned region 2) or to a 3′-proximal region of the genomic minus strand (plus-strand probe transcribed from cloned region 1)."

ALL_PANELS,"Vaccine Platforms
Multiple vaccine platforms have been explored for COVID-19 vaccine
development as each vaccine platform has unique advantages and disadvantages
(Table 1 and Figure 4).22 It is very likely that the world will need more than one
type of approved vaccine to combat this pandemic with assurance of
broad target population coverage, production quantities, and storage
and transportation requirements on top of vaccine safety and effectiveness."
ALL_PANELS,"Because it is inherently safe and uses well-established
techniques of protein purification, these vaccines comprise the largest
category in COVID-19 vaccine development, as shown in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"A total of 24 COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine candidates have entered
clinical trials, including those by Novavax, Anhui Zhifei Longcom
Biopharmaceutical, Kentucky Bioprocessing, and Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK) (Table 3), while
68 more are in preclinical evaluation (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Like mammalian
mRNA, mRNA vaccines produced by in vitro transcription
(IVT) contain an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5′ and
3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), a 5′-cap, and a 3′
polyadenylation (poly(A)) tail, as shown in Figure 5."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition,
without a cap, the IVT mRNA would be recognized as foreign RNA by
the host immune system through a mechanism mediated by Toll-like receptors
7/8.79 Capping of IVT mRNA would prevent
its recognition by the host immune system and reduce immunogenicity
caused by mRNA molecule itself.77,80
The elongated
poly (A) tail at the 3′ end is important for the stability
and subsequent translation of mRNA.81 Incorporation
of UTR sequences enhances mRNA half-life and translation efficiency.82 For example, incorporating a human β-globin
UTR to both 5′- and 3′-UTR of the mRNA has been shown
to enhance the stability and translational efficiency,83 whereas insertion of an α-globin UTR to
the 3′-UTR region increased the mRNA stability.84 Both 3′- and 5′-UTR regions can
also inhibit decapping and degradation of mRNA.83,84 As such, sequence modifications in both 5′- and 3′-UTRs
have been explored to enhance the mRNA vaccine functionality.85
In addition, unmodified IVT mRNA sequences
can stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate the innate immune
system.86 To reduce immunogenicity of the
IVT mRNA, a variety of modified nucleotides have been introduced into
the ORF region.86,87 For instance, designed incorporation
of pseudouridine (ψ) (Figure 6) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve
translation.88 Additionally, mRNA containing
N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1ψ) (Figure 6) exhibited an increase
in translational efficiency.89 Recent studies
have shown that this increase is related to N1-methyl-pseudouridine
induced enhancement of ribosome recycling to the same mRNA.90

ALL_PANELS,"Multiple vaccine platforms have been explored for COVID-19 vaccine
development as each vaccine platform has unique advantages and disadvantages
(Table 1 and Figure 4).22 It is very likely that the world will need more than one
type of approved vaccine to combat this pandemic with assurance of
broad target population coverage, production quantities, and storage
and transportation requirements on top of vaccine safety and effectiveness."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, unmodified IVT mRNA sequences
can stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate the innate immune
system.86 To reduce immunogenicity of the
IVT mRNA, a variety of modified nucleotides have been introduced into
the ORF region.86,87 For instance, designed incorporation
of pseudouridine (ψ) (Figure 6) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve
translation.88 Additionally, mRNA containing
N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1ψ) (Figure 6) exhibited an increase
in translational efficiency.89 Recent studies
have shown that this increase is related to N1-methyl-pseudouridine
induced enhancement of ribosome recycling to the same mRNA.90."

responsible for respiratory diseases, pose a significant threat to
global health.127 The spread of these RNA
viruses among the population may select for mutations that change
these viruses’ pathogenesis, virulence, and transmissibility,

"d, e, f","From the comparison, we see that all renderings (Fig. 3d–f) from approaches presented in this paper show internal structures more clearly (e.g. structures pointed by A) than other approaches by emphasising internal structures from the illumination perspective."
3f,Structures in Fig. 3f show larger illumination differences among structures than renderings in other figures.
4f,"More obviously, objects rendered in Fig. 4f show higher perceptual contrast in illuminations than other figures, which allows users more easily detect structural differences and structural details."
ALL_PANELS,"From the comparison in Fig. 5, we see that topological illumination shows more structural details such as skin surface and brain shapes (Fig. 5b to Fig. 5d) despite conventional illumination also depicting tumours clearly."
5d,It is found that perceptual illumination as shown in Fig.5d creates higher and balanced perceptual contrast between objects than other illumination methods.
ALL_PANELS,"For example, compared with conventional illumination, importance illumination emphasises structures which have high volume (thumb bones in Fig. 6b), and high persistence (kneecap in Fig. 7b)."

1a,We find that the number of newly highlighted genes increased most strongly between the mid-1990s and early 2000s (Fig 1A).
1a,"By 2018, 86% of all genes had been highlighted at least once, and 76% of all genes had been mentioned by one of their names in the title of at least 1 publication (Fig 1A)."
1b,"Third, starting in the late 1990s, only a vanishing fraction of gene–publication pairs published in a given year address newly (highlighted in the same year) or recently (highlighted within the past 5 years) highlighted genes (Fig 1B)."
1c,"Fourth, starting in the late 1990s, newly and recently highlighted genes became underrepresented relative to their absolute number (Fig 1C), even when accounting for the physiological importance of genes through their loss-of-function intolerance in human populations [32] (S4A Fig) or the occurrence of phenotypes in systematic murine mutagenesis experiments [33] (S4B and S4C Fig) or genome-wide association studies [34] (S4D Fig)."
1a,"Second, there already appears to be a saturation of the annual number of newly highlighted genes (Fig 1A)."
"a, sa","We find that until the early 2000s, the average and median number of authors on early-stage publications closely matches the average and median number of authors of publications highlighting only older genes (Fig 2A, S5A Fig)."
"a, sa","From 2010 onward, we observe that early-stage research into genes is produced by much larger teams than observed for teams authoring publications highlighting only older genes (Fig 2A, S5A Fig)."
"a, sa","This increase also exceeds the increase anticipated from extrapolating from preceding increases in mean and median team sizes (Fig 2A, S5A Fig)."
2b,"Supporting this view, we find that since the 1970s, the average number of genes highlighted in publications that newly highlight a gene is nearly the double of the average number of genes highlighted in publications that only highlight older genes (Fig 2B)."
2c,"Confirming our hypothesis, we find that since the mid-2000s, the probability of an early-stage research publication becoming highly cited was double that of publications highlighting only older genes (Fig 2C)."
2d,"Intriguingly, we observe that 1980s publications reporting early-stage research publications were more likely to be cited by clinical trials than publications on old gene targets (Fig 2D)."
"a, s","For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.Nonetheless, we find that some journals enrich for research publications on novel gene targets to an extent that is higher than anticipated by chance (red dots) (Fig 3A, S7 Fig)."
"b, s","Next, we focus on research publications on gene targets that were first highlighted in the 5 preceding years (Fig 3B, S7 Fig)."
"b, s","In contrast to the analysis for the enrichment for novel gene targets, when considering early-stage research, we find that few journals deplete for publications on early-stage research on gene targets to an extent that is higher than anticipated by chance (cyan dots) (Fig 3B, S7 Fig)."
3c,"Comparing the extent to which journals enrich for newly highlighted versus recently highlighted genes, we find that journals dedicated to neurobiology and obesity are enriching for recently highlighted genes to a larger extent than their enrichment for newly highlighted genes (Fig 3C)."
ALL_PANELS,"We consider funding agencies, distinct funding mechanisms, and NIH-supported research organizations (Fig 4, S8–S11 Figs)."
4a,"For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.The contexts implicated through funding agencies resemble those presented among journals—with the support for early-stage research between 2010 and 2018 preferentially stemming from genome biology (NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute [NHGRI]—one of several different agencies within the NIH), generalist funding agencies (NIH’s National Institute of General Medical Sciences [NIGMS], European Research Council, etc.), or funders of age-related neuropathies (Motor Neurone Disease Association and NIH’s National Institutes on Aging [NIA]) (Fig 4A–4C, S8 Fig)."
4a,"In line with a prior study that reported that Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators may be more willing to change their research focus [27], we also find that publications supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute are enriched for early-stage research (Fig 4A–4C, S8 Fig)."
4b,"This change contrasts with the funding patterns of Cancer Research UK, which has consistently supported researchers producing publications enriched for early-stage research (Fig 4B–4D, S8 Fig)."
4b,"Concluding our analysis of the research contexts under which early-stage research occurs, we investigate research organizations that are recipients of NIH grants (Fig 4B–4D, S11 Fig)."
ALL_PANELS,"For data underlying the figure, see https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-b5bm-3b17.Previously, we observed that early-stage research into genes engages more authors, highlights more genes, and is more likely to receive a higher number of citations (Fig 2)."
ALL_PANELS,We recognize that the previously noted increase in team size for early-stage research (Fig 2A) stems from genome biology (Fig 5C).
ALL_PANELS,"By contrast, the previously noted increase in the number of highlighted genes (Fig 2B) also persists outside of genome biology (Fig 5D) but is twice as large for genome biology, while publications on old gene targets highlight the same number of genes irrespectively of whether they fall within genome biology or not (Fig 5D)."
ALL_PANELS,The previously noted increased probability for early-stage research to become highly cited (Fig 2C) appears independent of genome biology (Fig 5E).
ALL_PANELS,"In line with the overall theme of our work, this further indicates the necessity and possibility to identify the specific contexts behind early-stage research as some beliefs about innovation might not generalize.Domain-specific research into a handful of genes contributes to early-stage research
While approaches used within genome biology are well positioned to identify novel gene targets [29] (Fig 5A), we previously observed that early-stage research on recent gene targets differs from early-stage research on novel gene targets by further extending to journals dedicated to neurobiology and obesity (Fig 3)."
1a,"We again focus here on the period of 2010 to 2018 for timeliness, but similar analyses for other periods are included in S17 Fig. During this time period, we find that 3,943 newly highlighted genes could have been investigated as recent gene targets (Fig 1A)."
3c,Journals are considered to disproportionally enrich for recent gene targets if they enrich for recent gene targets at least twice as much as they enrich for novel gene targets (above dashed line in Fig 3C). (D) Different top 40 genes are highlighted in publications from journals dedicated to different fields.
3c,Shown are journals that highlight recent gene targets and enrich for recent gene targets at least twice as much as they enrich for novel gene targets (above dashed line in Fig 3C).

ALL_PANELS,"Because of this bidirectional transfer of cells, a woman may host cells of fetal origin from her pregnancies and cells of maternal origin from her own mother (Figure 1).2 Furthermore, the same woman might host other cells transferred from her mother during fetal life, including cells possibly stemming from older siblings, a vanishing twin, or prior maternal termination of pregnancy,2,8,9 and even cells of neither fetal nor maternal origin stemming from maternal blood transfusion.9 Not all papers, however, demonstrate increased cFMC of older sibling origin, and further research is needed to uncover all potential sources of microchimerism in women.10
Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,"With both methods, the Y-chromosome is still often employed as a target for identifying microchimeric cells (Figure 2).2 FISH visualizes the cells in the context of surrounding maternal tissue, but is costly and time consuming."
ALL_PANELS,"Real-time PCR is simpler and more time efficient.11 With either method, the researcher may compare not only the prevalence of cFMC in different groups but also whether the relative quantities of cFMC differ in each subject (Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,This allows for microchimerism detection by FISH or by qPCR probes targeting the Y-chromosome (as shown here).Figure 3.
ALL_PANELS,"These probes are used to target paternally inherited fetal DNA sequences that the mother does not possess (Figure 4), thereby detecting microchimerism from male and female fetuses."
ALL_PANELS,"Boddy et al. hypothesize that cFMC may affect lactation, maternal thermoregulation, and mother–child bonding.6 Firstly, they cite a study showing that fetal microchimeric fibroblasts from mice differentiate into mammary epithelial cells when exposed to lactation hormones in vitro46 and another study showing that 56% of healthy parous women carry cFMC in their mammary tissue.47 Secondly, they present evidence that cFMC persists after pregnancy in maternal thyroid tissue48 and speculate that fetal cells may upregulate maternal body temperature in women with newborn infants.6 Finally, based on evidence that fetal cells in maternal mouse brains can differentiate into mature neurons49 and that cFMC may be found in the female human brain,50 they propose an evolutionary role for cFMC in strengthening the emotional tie between mother and child.6The impact of cFMC in inducing immunotolerance during pregnancy and temporary secondary effects on autoimmune disease
In addition to modulating maternal body function postpartum, maternal acquisition of fetal genetic material has been proposed to play a role in inducing materno-fetal tolerance during pregnancy, a factor potentially contributing to why certain autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are temporarily ameliorated during pregnancy.24 In 1993, a study by Nelson et al. looked into fetal–maternal disparity in HLA class II molecules,51 a concept illustrated in Figure 4."

ALL_PANELS,"For example, querying the phenotypic item “hypertension” returns the tree numbers that map to the natural language headings: “hypertension, malignant”; “hypertension, portal”; “hypertension, pulmonary”; “hypertension, renal”; “hypertension”; “masked hypertension”; “prehypertension”; etc (shown in Figure 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"An example of a ranked synonym set can be seen in Figure 3.Corpus Analysis
The aim of the corpus analysis step is to gauge the strength of the relationship between items in a phenotype."
ALL_PANELS,"In PIVET, the lift calculation entails dividing the percentage of times items appear together in the corpus by the product of percentages of times each item appears individually in the corpus, which can be rewritten as equation 2 in Figure 4, where count(A) is the number of articles in the corpus that contain the set A, and D is the number of documents in the corpus."
ALL_PANELS,"The number of subsets that had zero occurrences in the corpus is calculated using a simple combinatorial formula as shown in equation 3 in Figure 4, where S^j is the number of phenotypic items in phenotype j."
ALL_PANELS,"In conjunction with Figure 5 and Table 2, the results suggest that not all of the PheKnow-Cloud articles are relevant or directly related to the phenotypic item."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 6 plots the pooled normalized lift values for the 80 phenotypes based on the annotated significance level.
ALL_PANELS,"In the second set of experiments, we use PIVET’s full framework (Figure 1) to predict which phenotypes are clinically valid and show how PIVET can be used to examine phenotypes that are possibly clinically valid."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 7 illustrates the differences in the mean lift values between the various categories, with the gold and silver standard separated from the clinically significant group."
ALL_PANELS,"The yearly number of eligible non-English-language studies published in each journal has increased significantly over time, especially since 2000, in 6 out of the 12 languages covered (French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and simplified Chinese), with Portuguese and Russian showing a particularly rapid increase, while traditional Chinese also showed a marginally significant increase (Fig 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Studies in 10 out of the 16 languages we searched were significantly more likely to adopt less robust designs, compared to English-language studies, when controlling for the effect of study taxa and countries where English-language studies were conducted (Fig 2 and S1 Table)."
ALL_PANELS,"English-language studies were conducted in a total of 952 of the 2° × 2° grid cells and non-English-language studies in 353 grid cells, 238 of which had no English-language studies (those grid cells shown in black in Fig 3; also see Comparing study locations in Materials and methods)."
ALL_PANELS,"More non-English-language studies tended to be found in grid cells with fewer English-language studies, especially in East/Central/Western Asia, Russia, northern Africa, and Latin America (Figs 3 and S2), but the relationship was not significant when controlling for spatial autocorrelation (posterior median slope in a conditional autoregressive model: −0.012, 95% credible interval (CI): −0.032 to 0.005; see an inset in Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Although species with more studies in non-English languages also tended to have more studies in English for all 3 taxa (generalised linear mixed models for amphibians: slope = 0.12, z = 7.93, p < 0.001; birds: slope = 0.060, z = 13.18, p < 0.001; mammals: slope = 0.026, z = 5.65, p < 0.001; also see insets in Fig 4), non-English-language studies provided scientific evidence on the effectiveness of conservation interventions for an additional 9 amphibian, 217 bird, and 64 mammal species that were not covered by English-language studies (Fig 4), meaning 5%, 32%, and 9% increases in the evidence coverage of amphibian, bird, and mammal species, respectively."
ALL_PANELS,"We thus assessed the effects of excluding earlier volumes of long-running journals from our searches, by testing how the number of eligible studies changed over time in each journal (see Fig 1 for the result).


· Possibility of missing eligible studies
We tried to identify as many eligible studies as possible in each language, by making sure that (i) every searcher was well qualified and trained before starting the searches (see Searchers); and (ii) when in doubt, searchers keep, rather than reject, a study as potentially eligible, the validity of which was later assessed by independent experts (see Study validity assessment)."
ALL_PANELS,This would potentially affect the reported patterns in (i) the number and proportion of eligible studies among non-English languages (S1 Fig); and (ii) the proportion of different study designs among different languages (Fig 2).
ALL_PANELS,"Nevertheless, among-searcher variations in judgements should affect neither (i) yearly increases in the number of eligible non-English-language studies in each journal (Fig 1), as the same journal was searched by a single searcher, nor (ii) the spatial and taxonomic complementarity between English- and non-English-language studies (Figs 3 and 4), assuming that any such variations in assessment outcomes only affected a limited number of non-English-language studies and thus have not drastically changed the overall patterns in the differences between English and non-English-language studies.


· Effects of publication bias
We focused only on studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals and thus did not consider the effects of publication bias, caused by ignoring grey literature, within each language, while recognising that important scientific knowledge may also be published in non-English-language grey literature [29]."
ALL_PANELS,"Journals with 30 or fewer studies screened were excluded from this calculation, as the estimated proportions would be unreliable given the small sample size.Testing yearly changes in the number of eligible non-English-language studies
To test whether the number of eligible non-English-language studies had changed over time, we focused only on journals with 10 or more eligible studies, resulting in journals/studies in a total of 12 languages (shown in Fig 1) being used in the following analysis."
ALL_PANELS,The representative area covered by a grid cell in temperate areas is smaller than at the tropics and many of the new grids cells in Fig3 are tropical.

ALL_PANELS,The first set of questions were focused on understanding students experience and comfort with reading scientific papers (Figure 1).
ALL_PANELS,"When asked how many journal articles students read per month related to their research project, 29% (4 of 14) of students reported not reading any journal articles, 64% (9 of 14) reported reading 1–2 articles, and only 7% (1 of 14) reported reading 3–4 articles (Figure 2)."

7a,We obtained the list of nine genera from the study of bacteria associated with the gill tissues of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Eastern oyster [52].The findings on Arcobacter genomes with complete denitrification traits (Figure 7a) as well as the recommendation for research on Arcobacter strains and their hosts [56] led us to construct a denitrification potential dataset for 127 genomes taxonomically classified to the bacteria family Arcobacteraceae.
ALL_PANELS,"The ecosystem classification and counts of genomes according to denitrification potential revealed Arcobacteraceae strains inhabit engineered, environmental, and host-associated ecosystems (Figure 8)."

ALL_PANELS,This process was repeated to produce an MMI assessment for each of the nine assessment regions (Fig. 1) with a unique set of metrics and reference sites used in each region.
2a,StreamCat data are available at two scales: local catchments and full-contributing watersheds (Fig. 2A).
2b,"In this example, information from catchments 2 and 3 would then be linked to the split catchment to produce site-specific watershed data.Sample-specific watersheds
Many NRSA sample sites fell well above the outlet of the NHDPlusV2 stream segments (Fig. 2B)."
2b,"We used these flow rasters to delineate upstream contributing areas within these local catchment, thereby creating a site-specific catchment for these samples (i.e., dark grey area in Fig. 2B)."
2b,"We then overlaid these site-specific catchments onto the same set of geospatial layers used by Hill et al. (2016), and topologically linked them to upstream catchments (i.e., catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 2B) to calculate a suite of predictors for each NRSA site that matched the set of StreamCat metrics described above and in Appendix S2.Model development
We used RFs (Breiman 2001) to model and predict the probability of streams being in good biological condition."
ALL_PANELS,"National versus regional models
We compared a single, national model with models that were developed for each of the nine regions (i.e., a unique model for each region in Fig. 1)."
2b,"We then overlaid these site-specific catchments onto the same set of geospatial layers used by Hill et al. (2016), and topologically linked them to upstream catchments (i.e., catchments 2 and 3 in Fig. 2B) to calculate a suite of predictors for each NRSA site that matched the set of StreamCat metrics described above and in Appendix S2."
2b,"Sample-specific watersheds
Many NRSA sample sites fell well above the outlet of the NHDPlusV2 stream segments (Fig. 2B)."
ALL_PANELS,"We compared a single, national model with models that were developed for each of the nine regions (i.e., a unique model for each region in Fig. 1)."
3a,"For example, almost all Pr(good) values produced by the national model in the Coastal Plains region were below 0.5, even for sites that were assessed by NRSA to be in good condition (Fig. 3A)."
3b,"The opposite pattern was observed for sites in the Western Mountains region, where the model over predicted Pr(good) values of true poor sites (Fig. 3B)."
"c, d","Regional boxplots showed Pr(good) values that were unbiased, i.e., generally centered on Pr(0.5) (see Fig. 3C-D for example)."
ALL_PANELS,"Mean, standard deviation, and median of predicted probabilities of good biological condition by EPA National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) reporting region (see Fig. 1) and for the conterminous US (CONUS)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, the border between the Southern Appalachian and Coastal Plains regions was marked by a shift from lower to higher values of Pr(good), respectively (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, in the Potomac watershed (Fig. 6), catchments in Coastal Plains were comprised of similar or higher amounts of urbanization than catchments in Southern Appalachian at the regional boundary."
ALL_PANELS,"In the Northern Plains region, larger rivers that received much of their flow from the Bitterroot Mountains (western edge of Northern Plains; Fig 7) continued to have higher values of Pr(good) relative to adjacent first-order streams despite passing through land that is dominated by agriculture (Fig. 5)."
2a,"In addition, the definition of Flotemersch et al. (2015) was extended to local catchments within the NHDPlusV2 (see Fig. 2A for definitions of catchments and watersheds) to generate a national map of catchment integrity (ICI; index of catchment integrity)."
ALL_PANELS,"As an illustration, we selected streams that were within the upper 95th percentile of Pr(good) values within each region and mapped them by their Strahler stream order (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"For headwater streams, we excluded the criteria of IWI > 0.75 because the catchment and watershed are the same geographic unit (Fig. 2), and restoration of the ICI would result in a commensurate increase in IWI as well."
ALL_PANELS,"This query identified more than 7,300 km of streams within the CONUS that met these criteria (see Table 4 and Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, more than half of these stream lengths (4,659 km) were within the Temperate Plains region alone and were almost entirely comprised of 1st order catchments (Fig. 8), suggesting that local restoration efforts could substantially improve biological conditions within the upper Mississippi Basin."
ALL_PANELS,"The development of nine regional models ameliorated biases across regions, but produced sharp changes in predicted condition at regional borders (Fig. 6) and this pattern further supports the use and interpretation of NRSA MMIs on a regional, rather than national, basis."
3a,"Additionally, eleven of twelve students self-identified as a scientist, and ten of twelve students self-identified as a researcher (Fig. 3A)."

3c,"Despite their previous research experience and high degree of confidence in general skills, seven of twelve indicated that they had never presented a critique of a scientific journal article, and only two of twelve agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I regularly read scientific journal articles” (Fig. 3C)."
ALL_PANELS,The majority of the students sampled had taken more than three courses that included exposure to primary scientific literature (Fig. 5).
ALL_PANELS,"At our institution, a public, comprehensive, historically American Indian university, within a group of high achieving students who plan to attend medical or graduate school, the majority had not taken any classes that included reading and/or discussion of primary scientific literature (Fig. 5)."
3c,"In contrast, the mean response to the statement “I regularly read scientific journal articles” increased significantly (Fig. 3C)."
ALL_PANELS,The J–N regions of significance displayed in Figure 1 show that nostalgia increased activated PA at resilience values higher than 5.58 (+0.57 SD) and decreased it at resilience values lower than 2.50 (−2.22 SD).

"c, d","The SLF's preferred host, the Ailanthus altissima tree, has dense layered foliage consisting of pinnately compound leaflets (figure 1c,d) that likely offer numerous landing targets for falling insects."
1b,"Specimen body length, L = 11.8 mm [10.3, 12.6] mm (mean, range) (figure 1b), was measured to ±0.05 mm either using digital calipers (model SV-03-150, E-base Measuring Tools, Yunlin, Taiwan) or using the measure function in ImageJ [30] on digital photographs including a millimetre-ruled scale."
ALL_PANELS,"Body masses, m = 66 ± 18 mg, [40, 100] mg (N = 16, mean ± s.d., range), were measured to ±0.4 mg with an analytical balance (Explorer, Ohaus, Parsippany, NJ, USA). (See electronic supplementary material, table S1, for morphometric data.)

1c,We also note that this choice of falling distance lies in the range of distances between neighbouring leaflets in A. altissima trees (figure 1c).
2a,"We divided each falling trial into four periods for analysis: aerial, impact, post-impact and final landing (figure 2a)."
2b,Specimen orientation at the initial impact and final landing (i.e. after coming to rest post-impact) was scored by frame-by-frame video analysis into the best agreement with five categories similar to definitions used in [11] (figure 2b).
2c,"In the following, a body axis is referred to as ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ when it agrees with the respective direction within 45°, e.g. a horizontal cranial–caudal axis corresponds to θ ≤ ±45° (figure 2c)."
ALL_PANELS,"To determine whether release orientation impacted the distribution of orientations on impact and final landing, we considered three orientation outcomes for impact: upright, upside-down and other (comprising side, caudal and head down); and two for landing: upright and upside-down (figure 3)."
4a,"Aerial phase
Figure 4a shows a typical sequence of motions by live SLF nymphs during the aerial phase of the dropping experiments (electronic supplementary material, movie S1)."
4b,"In the majority of trials (97.1% = 135/139) artificially released specimens assumed a stereotypical falling posture within 0.079 s [0.029, 0.129] s after release, in which they spread their legs fully and held them slightly above the dorsal plane until impact (figure 4b)."
5b,"We were successful at filming a total of 15 voluntary release trials for five specimens from 354 mm [342, 365] mm above the hard substrate (figure 5b)."
4c,"All falling trajectories for all conditions agreed well with a quadratic drag model (R2 ≥ 0.9998; fit residuals 0.9 mm [0.7, 1.0] mm) (figure 4c)."
4d,"Terminal speed did not differ significantly between live specimens released voluntarily and artificially (Tukey's HSD, p = 0.48) (figure 4d)."
4d,"Dead specimens with their legs tucked had a mean terminal velocity that was greater than and statistically different from all other conditions (i.e. live and dead with legs spread) (Tukey's HSD, p < 0.0001), whereas analysis of live and dead with legs spread found no significant differences (Tukey's HSD, p > 0.74) (figure 4d)."
5a,"The rotation rate after release, Ωrel, of live specimens was significantly larger than for dead specimens (one-sided t-test p = 2.4 × 10−5 versus dead with legs spread and p = 0.0013 versus dead with legs tucked) (figure 5a)."
5b,"To illustrate how rotation rate changed during falling, we computed the change in rotation rate magnitude, Δ|Ω|, at the midpoint and impact relative to its value at release (figure 5b)."
7a,"While we were unable to release specimens above leaves reproducibly enough to study their impact and landing distributions per se, we did film 49 trials in which 15 different nymphs landed successfully on A. altissima leaves (1–6 landings/specimen) (figure 7a)."
7b,"The remaining 18% impacted on a combination of their caudal (6%), side (6%) or head (2%), or clung on impact to the edge of a leaflet (4%) (figure 7b)."
8b,"As expected from their greater release height, specimens released voluntarily impacted the surface at a significantly higher speed than those released artificially (Tukey's HSD, p = 0.001); impact speeds did not differ significantly between any of the other conditions (figure 8b)."
"b, c","The only other significant difference was between voluntarily released live specimens and dead/spread (Tukey's HSD, p = 0.015) (figure 8b,c)."

Are any acoustic features reliably different between song and speech across cultures?
1) Song uses higher pitch than speech

n = 81 pairs of audio recordings of song/speech, with each pair sung/spoken by the same person (Fig. 2)."
2b,"We did not collect standardized information about the function/context of songs, but the word clouds of lyrics translated to English (compare Fig. 2B) may provide an idea about what the songs are about, as do the English translations of the spoken descriptions (all available with other data at https://osf.io/mzxc8)."
ALL_PANELS,We compared the following six acoustic features (Fig. 3; compare the “Features” section in the Supplementary Materials for details) between song and speech for our main confirmatory analyses:.
ALL_PANELS,The results of the confirmatory hypothesis testing with 73 recording sets confirmed five of our six predictions (Fig. 4 and table S1; all P < 1 × 10−5).
ALL_PANELS,"This is an alternative visualization of the same sung/spoken data from Fig. 4, but showing mean values of each feature rather than paired differences, and now also including data for instrumental melodies and recited lyrics."
ALL_PANELS,"Note that the colors of data points indicate language families, which are coded the same as in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,We performed two exploratory analyses using automated methods to investigate (i) the reproducibility of our findings with another corpus and (ii) the applicability of automated methods to substitute data extraction processes involving manual work (Fig. 6; compare the “Exploring recording representativeness and automated scalability” section in the Supplementary Materials).
ALL_PANELS,"Similar to Fig. 5, mean values of each feature per recording can be found in the Supplementary Materials (figs."
ALL_PANELS,"However, only three to four f0 slopes (equal to the number of “phrases” or intervals from the first onset after a break and to the next break; compare Fig. 3) are, on average, included in the 20-s length recording of singing and spoken description, respectively, and so it is possible that this failed prediction could be due to the relatively more limited amount of data available for this feature."
ALL_PANELS,"Last, we also checked the average trend of f0 contours segmented by onset and break annotations (compare Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, on average, spoken pitch contours tend to descend more than sung pitch contours, explaining our failure to confirm our prediction that their contours would display similar pitch declination (compare Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"We also noticed that vocalizers sometimes end their utterance by raising pitch in their spoken description recordings (and lyrics recitation as well), causing a slight rise at the end of the averaged f0 contour of spoken description (and lyrics recitation; compare Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"The details of the computation is provided in the “Computation of average f0 contours of Fig. 7” section in the Supplementary Materials.Furthermore, the width of SEs around the mean contour (compare Fig. 7) suggests that spoken description and lyrics recitation have more homogeneous variations of contours than song and instrumental."
ALL_PANELS,The details of the computation is provided in the “Computation of average f0 contours of Fig. 7” section in the Supplementary Materials.
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the width of SEs around the mean contour (compare Fig. 7) suggests that spoken description and lyrics recitation have more homogeneous variations of contours than song and instrumental."
ALL_PANELS,"Main confirmatory predictions and their robustness
Our analyses strongly support five of our six predictions across an unprecedentedly diverse global sample of music/speech recordings: (i) Song uses higher pitch than speech, (ii) song is slower than speech, (iii) song uses more stable pitches than speech, (iv) song and speech use similar timbral brightness, and (v) song and speech use similar sized pitch intervals (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, the first three features display a shift of distribution along the musi-linguistic continuum, with instrumental melodies tending to use even higher and more stable pitches than song and lyric recitation tending to fall in between conversational speech and song (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Figure 4 shows many exceptions for four of the five features: for example, Parselelo (Kiswahili speaker) sang with a lower pitch than he spoke, and Ozaki (Japanese speaker) used slightly more stable pitches when speaking than singing, while many recording sets had examples where differences in sung versus spoken timbre or interval size were substantially larger than our designated SESOI."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead of our predicted similarities, our exploratory analyses suggest that, while both song and speech contours tend to decline toward the end of a breath, they tend to do so in different ways: song first rising before falling to end near the same height as the beginning, speech first descending before briefly rising at the end (Fig. 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Analysis of Hilton et al.’s (26) dataset of field recordings also supplemented our findings, producing qualitatively identical conclusions, regardless of the precise analysis methods or specific sample/subsample used (Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our analyses strongly support five of our six predictions across an unprecedentedly diverse global sample of music/speech recordings: (i) Song uses higher pitch than speech, (ii) song is slower than speech, (iii) song uses more stable pitches than speech, (iv) song and speech use similar timbral brightness, and (v) song and speech use similar sized pitch intervals (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"In general, many features followed the predicted “musi-linguistic continuum” with instrumental music and spoken conversation most extreme (e.g., most/least stable pitches respectively), with song and lyric recitation occupying intermediate positions (Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"These differences were consistent even when analyzed using matching subsamples speaking the same languages and using the same fully automated analysis methods (Fig. 6), suggesting that they are not due to differences in the sample of languages or analysis methods we chose."
ALL_PANELS,"At the same time, we were surprised to find that the two features that differed most between song and speech were not pitch stability and rhythmic regularity but rather pitch height and temporal rate (Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Since our main interest lies in the identification of which features demonstrate differences or similarities between song and speech, we perform the within-participants comparison of the six features between the pairs of singing and speech, using the spoken description rather than the lyric recitation as the proxy for speech (compare red boxes in Fig. 1; the comparisons with lyrics recitation and with instrumental versions are saved for exploratory analyses)."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, terms in the computed difference scores are arranged so that for our predicted differences (H1 to H3), a positive value indicates a difference in the predicted direction (compare Fig. 8)."
ALL_PANELS,We apply the meta-analysis framework to synthesize the effect size across recordings to make statistical inference for each hypothesis (Fig. 8).

ALL_PANELS,"Whitaker9 described an analysis as ""reproducible"" in the narrow sense that a user can produce identical results provided the data and code from the original, and ""generalizable"" if it produces similar results when both data are swapped out for similar data (""replicability""), and if underlying code is swapped out with comparable replacements (""robustness"") (Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"We contend that metadata have an undervalued role to play in addressing all of these issues and to shift the narrative from a crisis to opportunities.19
In the wake of this newfound interest in reproducibility, both the variety and volume of related case studies increased after 2015 (Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,Likert-style surveys and high-level publication-based censuses (see Figure 3) in which authors tabulate data or code availability are most prevalent.
ALL_PANELS,An independent discussion uses a secondary independent author to interpret the results of a study as a means to improve inferential reproducibility.Figure 3.
ALL_PANELS,"The standard enables documentation of important information about who collected the research data, when, and how, describing the methodology down to specific details and providing detailed taxonomic information about the scientific specimen being studied (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"So far, the closest attempt to decompose statistics in this manner is the STATO statistical ontology (http://stato-ontology.org/), which can be used to semantically, rather than programmatically or mathematically, define all aspects of a statistical model and its results, including assumptions, variables, covariates, and parameters (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"CWL manages the exacting specification of file inputs, outputs, parameters that are ""operational metadata"" used by the workflow machinery to communicate with the shell and executable software (Figure 6)."

ALL_PANELS,"A good example is the tximeta Bioconductor package (Figure 8), which implements reference transcriptome provenance for RNA-sequencing experiments, extending a number of popular transcript quantification tools with checksum-based tracking and identification.219 While this is an elegant solution, tximeta is focused on one analysis pattern."

ALL_PANELS,"Overview of physical mechanisms
To facilitate explaining the mechanisms of pollutant transport for the different designs adopted in this study, Figure 4 shows the velocity, TKE and concentration contours for selected cases, organized as follows: the contours are listed vertically in order of increasing LAD, and horizontally the contours on the left are without fence, while those on the right are the same designs when combined with fence."

Open in a new tab
Contours at 3 ms−1 for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only LAD 0.75 (Case 7), vegetation only LAD 1.5 (Case 8), fence only far from highway (Case 3), vegetation LAD 0.75 followed by 3m fence (Case 10), and vegetation LAD 1.5 followed by 3m fence (case 11) (a) Velocity; (b) TKE; (c) Normalized concentration."
ALL_PANELS,"Overall, cases with vegetation see 1) low velocity within the vegetation and accelerated flow around it (Figure 4a, Cases 7 and 8) compared to the no barrier case (Figure 4a, Case 1), 2) a region of reduced velocity (Figure 4a, Cases 7 and 8) and TKE (Figure 4b, Cases 7 and 8) right immediately behind the vegetation, referred to as “Low-TKE zone”, via short circuiting of turbulence by the vegetation (Poggi et al., 2004; Raupach and Thom, 1981; Finnigan, 2000), and 3) a “High-TKE zone”, after the Low-TKE zone, as a result of the turbulence produced from the shear at the vegetation top edge and in the wake."
4b,"In addition, clearly shown on the velocity contours (Figure 4b), denser vegetation (i.e., LAD = 1.5) leads to more drag imposed on the flow, which creates a “Recirculation Zone” in the vegetation wake (Case 8) that was not observed for vegetation with LAD = 0.75 (Case 7)."
"c, c","In terms of the concentration fields, pollutant dispersion is weak in the Low-TKE zone and the concentration roughly plateaus (Figure 4c, Cases 7 and 8, “Concentration plateau”)."
"a, c","Furthermore, the fence generates a recirculation region behind it (Figure 4a, Case 3, “Fence recirculation”)."
"b, c","The recirculation along with the shear generated at the fence top edge produces TKE immediately behind the barrier as depicted in Figure 4b, Case 3 (“Fence TKE”), which disperses pollutants and generates a well-mixed region behind the fence."
"b, c","When the fence is combined with vegetation it promotes vertical dispersion of pollutants and produces TKE immediately behind the vegetation (Figure 4b, Cases 10 and 11, “Fence TKE”), which effectively mitigates the plateau region observed for the vegetation only cases."
ALL_PANELS,"When the vegetation is less dense, the fence produces more turbulence since the velocity reaching the fence is higher due to less drag (Figure 4b, Cases 10) than the corresponding values for the denser vegetation case (Figure 4b, Cases 11)."
ALL_PANELS,"To facilitate explaining the mechanisms of pollutant transport for the different designs adopted in this study, Figure 4 shows the velocity, TKE and concentration contours for selected cases, organized as follows: the contours are listed vertically in order of increasing LAD, and horizontally the contours on the left are without fence, while those on the right are the same designs when combined with fence."

"c, c","Since the plateau region is longer for vegetation with LAD 0.75 (Figure 4c, Cases 10 and 11), adding a fence is advantageous because it results in enhanced reduction for a substantial distance behind the barrier."
8a,"Our results are consistent with those findings as smaller particles experienced reductions regardless of wind speed, whereas larger particles experienced an increase or no reduction in concentrations (Figure 8a)."

8a,"Figure 8a shows that for particle size 15 nm, for vegetation and vegetation with fence designs there are substantial reduction compared to the no barrier case."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 8 further demonstrates that a combination of a vegetation and fence results in more reduction of pollutants and adding a fence to the vegetative barrier at 1 ms−1 ensures that there is almost no harm being caused by the vegetative barrier.

2b,"The friction coefficient, μ, was analyzed across the middle 25% of the sliding path and generally increased with increasing sliding distance, as shown in Fig. 2b."
ALL_PANELS,"One potential explanation for the transient drop in friction coefficient seen in the Ra = 32 μm sample from 20 mm to 40 mm of sliding (equivalent to reciprocating cycles 2 and 3) in Fig. 2b may be transient run-in of the highest asperities, seen in Fig. 1d."

ALL_PANELS,"First, we excluded trial registrations, posters, and reports that did not examine the efficacy and effectiveness of the BAIs (e.g., protocols and cost-effective analysis reports) and reports with no count outcome variables (e.g., those reporting only binary or truly continuous outcomes), resulting in 64 reports from 54 trials with 119 count outcome variables (see Figure 1)."

in length and 2529 cm in width, containing 24 exam rooms and 8 physician work areas as shown
in Figure 2."
ALL_PANELS,"The PSO pseudo-code pertaining to
the problem of optimising the layout of an outpatient clinic is presented in Figure 4."
ALL_PANELS,"As part of the improvement in the MH algorithms, the solution quality can be enhanced
by optimising the MH parameters, such as  and  in Figure 4."
ALL_PANELS,"An example of
an infeasible layout is shown in Figure 5(a) where (i) the
waiting area overlaps with four exam rooms and (ii) one exam room (shaded square unit)
overlaps with another unit."
ALL_PANELS,"A feasible layout solution can be found by neighbourhood
search where the waiting area is rotated and the exam room is moved slightly, as shown
in Figure 5(b)."
ALL_PANELS,"The stopping
criteria used to terminate the PSO procedure, as shown in PSO pseudo-code in Figure 4, are the limit of a maximum number of iterations (10,000
times), or achieving less than a 1% solution improvement in 1000 runs."
ALL_PANELS,"Correspondingly, the candidate layouts in Figure 6 have relatively insignificant differences in terms of the pair-wise
walking distances (i.e., less than 8% difference in the objective function value)."
ALL_PANELS,"However,
the aggregate patient walking distances vary between the four layouts, as shown in the box
plots in Figure 7."
ALL_PANELS,"The histograms of patient walking distances for each of the candidate layouts are also
shown in Figure 8."

(a) If it cannot be determined whether a nanomaterial is present in the food/feed matrix or food simulant it should be assumed that nanomaterial is present. (b) The assessment of degradation products that are still in the form of nanoparticles should continue as presented in this Guidance.
ALL_PANELS,"•A stepwise approach (Figure 6) should be adopted for hazard identification and hazard characterisation to avoid unnecessary testing of nanomaterials.


•In Step 2, the rate of degradation of the nanomaterial to a non‐nanomaterial form under conditions representative of the gastrointestinal tract should be investigated."
ALL_PANELS,A stepwise approach (Figure 6) should be adopted for hazard identification and hazard characterisation to avoid unnecessary testing of nanomaterials.
ALL_PANELS,"Furthermore, if it cannot be demonstrated that the material quickly degrades, one should continue to Step 2 (Figure 2 or 6)."
ALL_PANELS,Assessment of the dissolution/degradation rate of nanomaterials in conditions representative of the human gastrointestinal tract is considered a key first step in the stepwise approach (Figure 6).
ALL_PANELS,"Both indices have values bounded by 0 and 1, with large values indicating relatively little surface texture (Olson, 2011; see Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,The first PC axis reflected the positive correlation between individual fruit size (area and mass) and fruit surface texture (low convexity and solidity values; see Figure 6 and PC1 loadings in Table S2).
ALL_PANELS,"The second PC axis was also related to fruit size and surface texture, but reflected another dimension of variability in which fruit surface texture and fruit size were negatively correlated for a subset of fruits (Figure 6; Table S2)."
ALL_PANELS,Figure 1 presents the PRISMA flow chart that visually represents the steps taken in the selection process.
ALL_PANELS,"Content analysis classified these behaviors into seven broader themes representing a general ‘life-crafting’ approach: cognitive crafting, environmental crafting, interest crafting, relational crafting, resources-demands crafting, skill crafting, and task crafting (see Figure 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, we used stringent review and evaluation procedures to identify relevant records and evaluate the intersection of these records to promote an inclusive and delineated model (see Figure 2)."
2a,"The results exactly agreed for 39/86 pairs (45.3 %), and discordance was noted for 47/86 pairs (54.7 %): quantitative discordance in 40 pairs and qualitative discordance in 7 pairs (Fig. 2a)."
2b,"If we defined agreement as exact agreement or < 10 % of discordance, discordance was observed for 33 pairs (38.4 %) (Fig. 2b)."
1b,These findings are reflected in the shorter time-to-publication for the funded RCTs compared with all other RCTs (log-rank p = 0.021) (Fig. 1b).
1d,"Abstracts reporting statistical significance for the main outcome were more likely to be published (123/228) than abstracts not reporting it (107/285) (RR = 1.44; 95 % CI = 1.19 to 1.74), and were published sooner (log-rank p < 0.001) (Fig. 1d)."
1e,"Among the 228 abstracts reporting statistical significance for the main outcome, no association was observed between the results being statistically significant and publication (RR = 0.97; 95 % CI = 0.76 to 1.24) or time-to-publication (Fig. 1e)."
1f,"COI and publication – overall and interaction analyses (models 1 and 2)
Abstracts with the first author reporting at least one COI had a greater likelihood of publication (RR = 1.31; 95 % CI = 1.04 to 1.64) (Table 4) and shorter time-to-publication (log-rank p = 0.026) (Fig. 1f) compared with all other abstracts."
"g, h","A positive association between COIs and publication was not observed for the last author or for any author, however (Table 4 and Fig. 1g and h)."
1f,Abstracts with the first author reporting at least one COI had a greater likelihood of publication (RR = 1.31; 95 % CI = 1.04 to 1.64) (Table 4) and shorter time-to-publication (log-rank p = 0.026) (Fig. 1f) compared with all other abstracts.
ALL_PANELS,"The 2000s accounted for the most articles (24), followed by the 1990s (17), 2010s (5), and 1980s (4) (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"The hip was the most discussed topic in the clinical studies, followed by the distal radius (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Study Area
The study area includes four distinct basins (Figure 1), of which Drin and Drina are river basins and Prespa and Skadar are lake basins."
3a,"Functional components
The functional components (Figure 3A) reflect the integrity of the individual environmental systems of a watershed."
3b,"The regions with the lowest ICI values (Fig. 3B) were near the confluence of the Drina and the Sava and in NW Albania, while those with the highest ICI values were within the Dinaric Alps (central Montenegro, SE Bosnia, N and E Albania)."
ALL_PANELS,"In terms of biogeographic zones (Figure 1), the mean Alpine ICI was 0.53 (SD = 0.15), the mean ICI of the Mediterranean Zone was 0.46 (SD = 0.18), and the mean ICI of the Continental Zone was 0.34 (SD = 0.13)."
ALL_PANELS,"Similar to the ICI results, IWI spatial trends (Figure 3C) were largely influenced by biogeographic zone (Figure 1)."
3a,This variability between the functional components (Figure 3A) can be useful to national managers (see 4.2 Management Applications).
ALL_PANELS,"Given that cultural services such as recreation or stewardship are regularly managed at the local scale (Plieninger et al. 2013), whereas regulating services, such as river flood mitigation, are often managed at the national or international scale (Stürck et al. 2014), the levels of information provided by the ICI and the IWI of streams, watersheds, and basins inform the respective local, national, and international management entities (Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,The three levels of information additionally accommodate scientific recommendations to manage aquatic features at multiple ecological scales (Figure 4) (Allan et al. 1997; De Groot et al. 2010).
3a,"By identifying the functional component with the lowest value in an individual catchment or watershed, the national management authority can identify the individual source(s) of stress (Figure 3A)."
3d,Hill et al. (Hill et al. 2017) suggest that the success of biological resource management would increase if management targeted areas with low catchment integrity and high watershed integrity (Figure 3D).
3d,"To increase restoration feasibility, managers can identify catchments with high IWI values (the blue and green catchments identified in Figure 3D)."
ALL_PANELS,"The study area includes four distinct basins (Figure 1), of which Drin and Drina are river basins and Prespa and Skadar are lake basins."
3a,The functional components (Figure 3A) reflect the integrity of the individual environmental systems of a watershed.
ALL_PANELS,"A subsequent surgical debridement was performed (Fig 1) during which sampled tissue was subjected to further microbiological testing, including being sent for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and mycobacterial culture."
ALL_PANELS,An X-ray of the affected finger confirmed changes consistent with osteomyelitis of the middle and proximal phalanges (Fig 2).
ALL_PANELS,"A red mark on the inner side of his right upper arm evolved into a small ulcer by late June, suggesting an incubation period of four to five weeks (Fig 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"The core genome tree distinctly delineated the Batemans Bay isolates, setting them apart from the clinical isolates in Victoria in their own clade (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, the isolates from Batemans Bay and Far East Gippsland are situated on a distinct branch of the phylogenetic tree, which merges at the most recent common ancestor of M. ulcerans in south-eastern Australia (Fig 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"The relatively long branch length of the Batemans Bay M. ulcerans genomes, revealed by the phylogenomic analysis, is consistent with—as yet—unsampled genetically diverse M. ulcerans present on other areas of Australia (Fig 6)."

Risk of Bias
The risk of bias assessment for individual studies is presented in Fig. 2."
ALL_PANELS,"Positive parenting interventions led to significant improvements in children’s mental abilities, based on 5746 participants (g = 0.46; 95% CI 0.32, 0.61, p < 0.0001, k = 33; Fig. 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"Studies that were scored as having a higher risk of bias yielded larger effect sizes than those that were rated as having a lower risk of bias (β =  − 0.07, CI − 0.13, − 0.003, p < 0.05, z = − 2.07; Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Higher scores on risk of bias represents lower risk of biasWhen statistically significant moderators (risk of bias scores and method of assessment) were simultaneously entered into a meta-regression, risk of bias was significant (β =  − 0.07, CI − 0.13, − 0.004, p < 0.05, z = − 2.09), and instrument measurement was reduced to p < 0.10 (β =  − 0.32, CI − 0.70, 0.06, z =  − 1.64).Language
Based on a meta-analysis of 30 studies (n = 6248), positive parenting interventions led to significant gains in children’s language skills (g = 0.25, 95% CI 0.14, 0.35, p < 0.0001; Fig. 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill procedure indicated six studies imputed to balance reported positive intervention effects, based on random effects models (adjusted point estimate = 0.16 (95% CI 0.05, 0.27; Fig. 6)."

Meta-regression of Hedge’s g on child age (at baseline) for language meta-analysisWhen child age (at baseline), parental education, and father involvement were entered into a meta-regression simultaneously, child age at baseline (β = − 0.01, CI − 0.01, − 0.0003, z = − 1.85) was reduced to near-significance (p = 0.06), whereas parental education and father involvement were no longer significant moderators.Executive Functioning
There were 14 studies (n = 3628) included in the meta-analysis of executive functioning outcomes, with results indicating a nonsignificant pooled effect size (g = 0.07; 95% CI − 0.09, 0.23, ns; Fig. 8)."

ALL_PANELS,"After doing this, each window contains the aperture domain data for multiple frequencies, and the completion of this step corresponds to the completion of (A) in Fig. 1."
ALL_PANELS,"In this case, 115,200 total model fits must be performed, so each one of these model fits will be assigned to one thread as shown in Fig. 4."
ALL_PANELS,The solid red lines represent minimizing the objective function with respect to one model coefficient at a time.Fig. 4.
ALL_PANELS,"Note that in Fig. 2, image display is listed under CPU due to the fact that MATLAB is used to display the processed image."
ALL_PANELS,"CPU ADMIRE vs. GPU ADMIRE Benchmarks
Fig. 6 shows the simulated cyst dataset processed with DAS using different GPU cases, ADMIRE using different GPU cases, and ADMIRE using a CPU."
ALL_PANELS,"Nevertheless, as a test, the channel data for the dataset that was used to create Fig. 6 was time-delayed on the GPU."
ALL_PANELS,"Effect of Imaging and Processing Parameters on Run Time
In regard to the effect of imaging and processing parameters on the GPU implementation of ADMIRE, Fig. 7 demonstrates that there is a linear relationship between processing time and three of the parameters that were studied (number of depth samples, number of elements per beam, and number of beams)."
ALL_PANELS,Fig. 7 shows that the processing time decreases as each of these parameters are increased until it eventually levels out.
ALL_PANELS,"Based off of the timings where the original data was processed (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7), the average processing time using the multi-GPU implementation ranged from approximately 0.168s to 0.173s."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, Fig. 8 shows that the majority of the processing time for ADMIRE is spent in the model fitting and reconstruction stage."
ALL_PANELS,"The case in Fig. 10 and the case in Fig. 11 were the slowest due to the fact that scan conversion was performed, and a finely sampled cartesian grid was used."
ALL_PANELS,"As shown in Fig. 6, when compared to the CPU implementation of ADMIRE, the GPU implementation for both of the single GPU cases and the multi-GPU implementation all provide a speedup of two orders of magnitude.B."
ALL_PANELS,"Now, besides the effects of these parameters on the computational aspects of ADMIRE, the number of depths, the number of elements per beam, and the number of beams can also affect the time taken for memory operations to occur as shown in Fig. 8."
ALL_PANELS,"As previously stated, these operations are included in the processing times in Fig. 7, so reducing them also decreases the processing times."
ALL_PANELS,"In addition, for varying the number of beams, the processing time appears to change by a larger amount when the number of beams changes by a multiple of 32, as shown in Fig. 7."
ALL_PANELS,This is why the processing time for the model fitting and reconstruction stage is similar for these two cases in Fig. 8.
ALL_PANELS,"Effect of GPU Hardware on Run Time
In regard to the effect of the type of GPU on processing time, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show that when compared to the 1080 Ti GPU, running ADMIRE on the 2080 Ti GPU is approximately 2.2 times faster."
ALL_PANELS,"Fig. 6 shows the simulated cyst dataset processed with DAS using different GPU cases, ADMIRE using different GPU cases, and ADMIRE using a CPU."

ALL_PANELS,"Study design
This study employs a participatory qualitative design, with participant asked to use one of two mobile applications for two weeks (randomly allocated), document their experience during those two weeks using photovoice techniques, and participate in a follow-up interview (see Fig. 1)."
2a,"And it wasn't such a huge jump from ‘I do nothing’ to ‘time to exercise all the time’.” (Participant 08, Map My Fitness, see Fig. 2A)
“I really like this feature about the app - how you can record the duration, calories.."
2b,"But they made me feel, more like, motivated, to work out.” (Participant 01, FitOn, see Fig. 2B)Ineffective reminders were perceived differently
A few participants discussed that reminders were not effective at prompting exercise, due to time barriers or low motivation."
2c,"However, with the app, I could do indoor exercises, obviously, and ones in smaller spaces, which I found a much better alternative to doing nothing.” (Participant 12, FitOn, see Fig. 2C)Trainers need to be relatable
The relatability and diversity of trainers affected participants’ engagement."
2d,"These participants discussed that social features should be designed on an opt-in basis to prioritise the safety of female users.
“I guess it's sort of also, you have a bit more like accountability, if you know, the people around you are also using the app... having like my boyfriend or my friend, like, not necessarily push me but be like, “Oh, I'm going to do this workout.” And then that would sort of motivate me to do it as well or work out with them... that was pretty much the only thing that would have had motivated me to actually do it.” (Participant 32, FitOn, see Fig. 2D)
“But then when I clicked into it, it came up with the route and then my neighbour's name."

Overall Reporting Compliance of Study Experimental Variables
The average combined reporting compliance of all variables is presented in Figure 1."
ALL_PANELS,The distribution of variables reported above and below average reporting compliance levels shows a clear pattern with regard to variable category (Fig. 2).
ALL_PANELS,"The 10 variables with lowest reporting compliance, on the other hand, comprise almost exclusively innate biological as well as experimental condition variables (Fig. 2)."
ALL_PANELS,"As another example of a variable that may just be viewed as “not worth reporting,” the prandial state of experimental animals was underreported compared with many more overtly controlled variables (Fig. 2, Supplemental Table S1)."
ALL_PANELS,The distribution of variables reporting compliance levels shows a clear pattern with regard to variable category (Fig. 2).

ALL_PANELS,"The primary analysis showed that mean d-dimer is significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease than in those with severe infection (SMD − 2.15 [− 2.73 to − 1.56], I2 98%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, panel A)."
ALL_PANELS,"Similarly, we found a much lower mean d-dimer in Survivors compared to Non-Survivors (SMD − 2.91 [− 3.87 to − 1.96], I2 98%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, panel B)."

ALL_PANELS,"Of note, a similar result was observed even when Survivors were compared to Non-Survivors (SMD 1.84 [1.16 to 2.53], I2 97%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4, panel D)."
ALL_PANELS,"Interestingly, shorter mean PT was found in both Non-Severe (SMD − 1.34 [− 2.06 to − 0.62], I2 98%, P < 0.0002) (Fig. 4, panel B) and Survivors groups (SMD − 1.61 [− 2.69 to − 0.54], I2 98%, P < 0.003) (Fig. 4, panel E) compared to Severe and Non-Survivor patients."

This review article analyzed the literature through the databases of Google Scholars, Web of Science, and other web sources using keywords such as ‘MP toxicity and plant growth’, ‘MPs uptake and seed germination’, ‘MPs and alteration in soil fertility’, ‘MPs direct impact on plant’, ‘MPs and root cell wall’, ‘MPs and redox regulation in plants’, MPs uptake and translocation in plants, ‘MPs and biochar application and plant growth’, ‘plant growth regulators and MPs toxicity in plants’, and ‘Biodegradation of MPs’ (
Figure 1B

2a,"MPs after fragmentation can enter roots via cracks on newly developed roots (
Figure 2A
) and enter xylem or phloem vessels (Li et al., 2020)."
2b,"MP stress negatively regulates these factors, thus reducing photosynthesis in plants (Yang and Gao, 2022; 
Figure 2B
)."
2b,"Besides influencing the stomatal and non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis, MP stress also reduces photosynthesis by affecting shoot and 
leaf ionome
 and causing the production of ROS (
Figure 2B
)."
2c,"The chloroplast is among the primary sites of 
ROS production
 during photosynthesis (
Figure 2C
), as the chloroplast converts light energy into energy required for chemical bonding."
2b,"Given the above discussion, it can be suggested that MP stress-induced reduction in photosynthesis (
Figure 2B
) results from six complementary mechanisms: (i) higher ROS production, leading to oxidative stress, (ii) structural damage and modification of membrane proteins in PSII, (iii) conversion of chlorophyll to phytol and plausibly higher activity of chlorophyllase enzyme due to higher ROS production, (iv) peroxidation of the chloroplast and thylakoid membrane, (v) alteration in leaf ionome, and (vi) alteration in gene expression relating to the photosynthesis system."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, we presented a model (
Figure 3
) and according to this model, we speculated that upon the entry of MP particles in roots, MPs induce membrane depolarization and increase ROS production in the cytosol."
ALL_PANELS,"Thus, the different reaction activity of different antioxidants also determines the levels of overall ROS production under MP stress (
Figure 4
)."

NA, not applicable.The model outcome suggests, with a probability of 1 (median of the uncertainty distribution), that at least one migratory water bird infected with HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 enters the EU via the NE route (see Figure 1, Appendix E)."
ALL_PANELS,"When 648 susceptible water birds enter daily (i.e. when the total population size at the end of the migratory season reaches 100,000 wild birds), the prevalence increases after 2 days and reaches a plateau around day 25 of the migration season (median 0.002, 95th percentile24 0.029 at the end of the migration season i.e. day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 1, population capacity 100,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"Then, the virus prevalence increases gradually in the wild bird reservoir until the end of the migration season (median 0.000, 95th percentile 0.020 at day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 1, population capacity 10,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"In scenario 3, due to the high number of resident water birds, virus prevalence immediately increases within the wild bird reservoir after the entry of infected wild water birds (95th percentile 0.020 at day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 3, population capacity 100,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"Having sufficient susceptible resident wild birds but lowering the number of infected wild water birds entering, results in lower maximum prevalence levels in the wild bird reservoir (95th percentile 0.004 at day 125) (see Figure 5: scenario 3, population capacity 10,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"Scenario 1: 90% water birds, 90% migratory birds; scenario 2: 10% water birds, 90% migratory birds; scenario 3: 90% water birds, 10% migratory birds; scenario 4: 10% water birds, 10% migratory birds
Reducing the number of water birds in the wild population (scenarios 2 and 4), will lead to an epizootic in the residential wild bird population only when considerable numbers of susceptible water birds enter (see Figure 5, scenario 2)27 or considerable numbers of susceptible water birds are resident (see Figure 5, scenario 4).28

Simulating entry of infected wild water birds in the middle of the migration season (day 60) suggests immediate onset of an epizootic in the wild bird reservoir as the critical number of susceptible water birds is already available (see Figure E.2, Appendix E)."
ALL_PANELS,The HPAI prevalence in wild water birds at the end of the migration season is similar to the level obtained when infected wild birds arrive already in the beginning of the migration season (comparison Figure 5 with Figure E.2).
ALL_PANELS,"The evolution of the daily probability of a holding without biosecurity to become HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 infected during the migratory season (see Figure E.4, Appendix E) follows the kinetics of virus prevalence in wild water birds (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"The median seasonal probability of poultry holdings without biosecurity becoming HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 infected is 0 and 2 (94 and 407, 95th percentile) per 1,000 holdings when considering wild bird populations of 10,000 and 100,000 birds, respectively (Figure 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on these values, the implementation and maintenance of carefully selected and adapted biosecurity measures are key in the protection of poultry holdings from AIV incursions (Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"For HPAIV clade 2.3.2.1c, there are various reports of infected wild birds (and poultry) in Central Asia (see Figure 1 in Section 3.1.1)."
ALL_PANELS,"For HPAIV clade 2.2.1.2, there are detections reported in wild birds in Egypt as well as in poultry in Egypt and its directly neighbouring countries such as Libya, Palestinian Territories (see Figure 1 in Section 3.1.1)."
ALL_PANELS,"For HPAIV clade 2.3.2.1c, poultry outbreaks have been reported in multiple sub‐Saharan West African countries (see Section 3.1.1 and Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Viruses of clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1c have never been reported in North America (Figure 1, Section 3.1.1), hence the probability that they enter the EU via the NW route is extremely low (more than 1,000‐fold lower) compared with HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 entry via the NE route.3.2.7."
ALL_PANELS,"When the prevalence of infected entering water birds is high (0.06, see scenario 1 in Figure 8), an immediate onset of the epidemic and a rapid increase in the prevalence of infected water birds is observed during the first 10 days."
ALL_PANELS,"When an average of 39 susceptible water birds enter daily, the prevalence immediately increases and reaches a maximum around day 10 (median 0.013, 95th percentile 0.017) and then decreases to 0.003 (95th percentile 0.007) at the end of the considered period (i.e. day 125) (see Figure 8: scenario 1, population capacity 100,000 birds)."
ALL_PANELS,"When compared with HPAI (see Figure 5 in Section 3.2.2), it can be concluded that LPAIV can reach similar maximum prevalence levels."
ALL_PANELS,"Probability of LPAI entry into poultry holdings without biosecurity measures
The evolution of the daily probability of a holding without biosecurity becoming LPAI infected during a period of 125 days (see Figure E.9, Appendix E) follows the kinetics of virus prevalence in wild water birds (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"The median probability of poultry holdings without biosecurity becoming LPAI infected over the season (125 days) is 9 and 12 (796 and 863, 95th percentile) per 10,000 holdings when considering wild bird populations of 10,000 and 100,000 birds, respectively (Figure 9)."
ALL_PANELS,"As a result, there were high numbers of detections made by passive surveillance in anseriforme and game bird holdings during the 2016/2017 HPAI epizootic (Figure 10; see also EFSA scientific report 2017b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Sampling carried out on ducks and geese between 2014 and 2016 can be found in Figure 11, while sampling carried out on game birds (both gallinaceous and anseriforme) over the same time period can be found in Figure 12."
ALL_PANELS,"Based on the wild bird HPAI findings during these epizootics, a predictive risk map was created using a logistic regression model analysing the relationship between reported wild bird events and environmental factors (Figure 13; see Section 2.7)."
ALL_PANELS,"Instead of active wild bird surveillance across the EU (as done in the past), a few priority locations within the EU could be identified (e.g. based on Figure 13) to implement targeted wild bird surveillance combining active virology tests (swabbing) with enhanced passive surveillance."

ALL_PANELS,"Viruses of clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1c have never been reported in North America (Figure 1, Section 3.1.1), hence the probability that they enter the EU via the NW route is extremely low (more than 1,000‐fold lower) compared with HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 entry via the NE route."

ALL_PANELS,"On each trial, participants viewed an array of moving dots (i.e., random dot kinematogram), presented in one of four colors (see Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"At the end of the experiment, participants received a bonus calculated from their performance (mean(SD) bonus: $2.5($0.57)USD).Regression Analyses
We used a hierarchical nonlinear regression of choice and reaction time as a tractable and minimally theory-laden measure of performance (Supplementary Figure 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"To provide finer-grained insights into our model fit, we generated additional posterior predictive checks that aggregate trends across all participants (Supplementary Figure 6) and that highlight single participants (Supplementary Figure 7)."
ALL_PANELS,"To provide further validation of the robustness of our parameter estimation procedure, we performed parameter recovery (simulated behavior from our best-fitting regression parameters, refit our model to this simulated behavior, and the compared data-generating and recovered parameters; Supplementary Figure 8) and parameter knock-out analyses (re-fit models with key nuisance regressors removed; Supplementary Figure 9)."
ALL_PANELS,"We generated sensitivity dynamics plots (e.g., Figure 6) by computing the regression-estimated coherence effect conditioned on RT."

ALL_PANELS,"Feature coherence and RT were rank-ordered and binned into quantiles with equal numbers of trials at each level of target coherence, distractor congruence, or RT bin.Feedforward Inhibition with Control Model
To provide a bridge between our regression analyses and processes models of decision-making, we adopted a generative modeling approach and tested whether participant behavior could be reproduced by a sequential sampling model (Figure 8)."
1a,"This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered.Results
Participants performed the Parametric Attentional Control Task (PACT), a perceptual discrimination task that required them to classify the dominant color in an array of moving dots (Figure 1a)."
1b,"Across trials, we varied the extent to which those dots were coherently moving in the same or opposite direction as the correct response (distractor interference; Experiments 1–3) and how easily the participant could determine the dominant color (target discriminability; Experiments 2–3; Figure 1b)."
1c,"To enhance the potency of motion as a distracting dimension (Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977) and allow for additional measures of automaticity and feature-specificity, participants alternated between these blocks-of-interest and shorter blocks (20–50 trials) in which participants instead responded to the direction of dot motion (Attend-Motion PACT; Figure 1c)."
1b,We varied the strength of this distractor dimension between being fully congruent with the correct color response (100% leftward coherence for a left color response) to being fully incongruent (100% rightward coherence for a left color response; Figure 1b).
"c, t","Both accuracy (Cohen’s  on regression estimate; d = −1.47) and reaction time (d = 1.25) worsened with parametrically increasing levels of interference (ps < 0.001, Figure 2c, Table 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Y-axis range is matched within-feature across tasks, see Supplementary Figure 10 for matched y-axes across all features and tasks."
"a, t","Participants in both studies were faster (Exp 2: d = −1.90, Exp 3: d = −1.99) and more accurate (Exp 2: d = 3.27, Exp 3: d = 3.73) with parametrically increasing levels of color coherence (aggregate ps < 0.001; Figure 2a, Table 1)."
"a, t","At the same time, we continued to find that participants were slower and less accurate when the goal-irrelevant movement of those dots was increasingly incongruent with the correct color response (see Figure 2a, Table 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"We found that participants were more sensitive to the nowrelevant motion coherence (Figure 2e), but were no longer sensitive to the now-irrelevant color congruence (Figure 2g; Supplementary Table 1–2)."
ALL_PANELS,"Across all three of our studies, we found that participants’ sensitivity to the distractor dimension was robustly and parametrically influenced by the distractor congruence on the previous trial, as reflected both in their choice (ds = 1.44 to 1.74, p < .001; Figure 3a) and RT (ds = 0.83 to 1.79, p < .001; Figure 3b; Table 2)."
"a, b","When the previous trial had congruent distractors, participants had strong sensitivity to the distractor congruence (Figure 3a–b, navy)."
"a, b","When the previous trial had incongruent distractors, participants were much less sensitive to distractors (Figure 3a–b, red)."
"d, e","P-values are aggregated across experiments, with statistically significant p-values (two-tailed, α = 0.05) shown in bold.When varying both target and distractor features (Experiments 2–3), we found an additional influence of previous distractor congruence on target processing, whereby more incongruent previous trials enhanced the influence of target discriminability on the current trial (Figure 3d–e)."
ALL_PANELS,"However, the influence of previous distraction on target processing was substantially smaller than its effect on distractor processing (see Figure 5), and was only found for accuracy (p < .001) and not RT (p = .57), Finally, we found that performance adapted to the strength of the previous target, with less-discriminable targets yielding lower sensitivity to target strength (i.e., poorer performance) on the following trial, potentially due to disengagement (Supplementary Figure 2, Table 2)."
1d,"In Experiment 3 we incorporated an incentive manipulation, with blocks of trials for which participants could either earn a monetary reward for fast and accurate performance, and blocks where performance was not rewarded (Figure 1d)."
"a, t","We found that participants’ accuracy was more sensitive to target discriminability in rewarded blocks than non-rewarded blocks (d = 0.61, p < .001; Figure 4a, Table 3)."
ALL_PANELS,"To confirm these findings, we formally tested the double dissociation between how incentives and previous interference influenced target and distractor choice sensitivity (Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,"At the earliest RTs, participants were the least sensitive to targets (Figure 6a) and the most sensitive to distractors (Figure 6d)."
6b,"We found that participants had steeper target coherence slopes on error trials (ds = 0.89 to 1.5, p < .001; Figure 6b), driven by faster errors when the targets were high coherence, consistent with participants responding before their maximal target sensitivity."
6e,"Likewise, we found that the relationship between RT and distractor congruence inverted on error trials (ds = −0.68 to −1.8, p < .001; Figure 6e), with participants making faster errors on more incongruent trials, consistent with an early sensitivity to distractors that is suppressed over time."
6h,"During these blocks, we found that participants enhanced target (motion) sensitivity faster than they did during Attend-Color blocks (p < .001; Figure 6h; Supplementary Table 8–9)."
ALL_PANELS,"However, later in the experiment participants also had faster target and distractor dynamics, such that maladaptive sensitivity was most prominent in the earliest phase of the trial (Supplementary Figure 11)."
7a,"We found that after incongruent trials, participants started the next trial more sensitive to targets and less sensitive to distractors (Figure 7a)."
7d,"We found that during incentivized blocks, participants’ initial target sensitivity was higher than during non-incentivized blocks, and remained so across much of the trial (see Figure 7d)."
7d,"However, target sensitivity eventually reached an asymptote, such that towards the end of the trial both incentivized and non-incentivized trials had similar levels of target sensitivity (see slowest quantile in Figure 7d)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our decision model takes as inputs the color and motion coherence in support of different responses, nonlinearly transforms these inputs, and then integrates evidence for each response in separate rectified accumulators with balanced feedforward excitation and inhibition (Figure 8)."
ALL_PANELS,"During our main Attend-Color trials, it generated responses that were faster and more accurate with increasing color coherence (Figure 9a) and slower and less accurate with increasing motion incongruence (Figure 9b)."
ALL_PANELS,"Now, our model generated responses that were even faster and more accurate with increasing target coherence (now motion; Figure 9c) but that were insensitive to distractor congruence (now color; Figure 9d), replicating the main behavioral results in Attend-Motion blocks."
ALL_PANELS,"Notably, distractor effects were not reproduced in an accumulator competition model parameterized to be more ‘race-like’ (Supplementary Figure 3; (Teodorescu and Usher, 2013)."
10a,"In accuracy, our model replicated the shift in target sensitivity over time, with the collapsing bound reducing performance on the slowest trials (Figure 10a)."
"c, d","Finally, our model recreated the analogous effects in RT, with faster errors for high coherence targets and incongruent distractors (Figure 10c–d)."
ALL_PANELS,"Critically, we were unable to replicate these qualitative patterns of behavior with FFI models in which control gains that were frozen throughout the trial (Supplementary Figure 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"Drift diffusion models with across-trial variability in gain, noise, or threshold; or drift diffusion models with within-trial dynamics in noise or threshold were similarly unable to capture our key effects without within-trial gain dynamics (Supplementary Figure 5)."
"a, l","This is evident in poorer overall performance in the slowest RT bin, relative to the 2nd-4th bins (see Figure 10a, left panel, pink line)."
ALL_PANELS,"Our simulation captured this global reduction in accuracy by including a collapsing boundary (Drugowitsch et al., 2012; Rosenbaum et al., 2022), which leads to late errors irrespective of feature coherence (see Supplementary Figure 5 for contrast to fixed bound)."
10a,"Notably, even though overall accuracy is reduced over time, target sensitivity is stronger at the slowest RT bin relative to the earliest RT bin (compare navy and pink psychometric slopes in Figure 10a), consistent with both feature-selective dynamics (gain control) and global dynamics (collapsing bound)."
"c, d","As in participants’ behavior, the model’s errors due to incongruent distractors tend to occur early (Figure 10c–d), censoring target processing at a lower (early) level of sensitivity."
11a,"To account for the early effects of conflict and incentives, we modified the initial conditions of our model’s gain dynamics (Figure 11a)."
7b,"After congruent trials, participants started the next trial with more similar target and distractor gains, that were then more quickly separated within the trial (Figure 7b)."
6d,"Interestingly, participants appeared to suppress distractor sensitivity even on congruent trials, evident in the right half of Figure 6d (see also (Mante et al., 2013; Pagan et al., 2022)), suggesting that they are not reactively adjusting this control policy when the trial conditions deem it unnecessary or even detrimental."
ALL_PANELS,"To address these concerns, we used simulations to show that the dynamic profiles we observed cannot be accounted for by an evidence accumulation model with static gains on target and distractor processing (Supplementary Figure 4) or models with dynamic changes to non-selective components like decision threshold (Supplementary Figure 5)."
ALL_PANELS,Introducing dynamic feature gains allowed us to account for those same patterns (Figures 9 to 11; Supplementary Figure 5).

ALL_PANELS,"This article illustrates such an approach, on a knowledge graph database, through the combination of a robust visualization grammar (Vega-Lite) and the query language for the semantic web (SPARQL) (Fig. 1)."
ALL_PANELS,"Depending on the SPARQL query, datasets vary from individual sample data linked to a research article to meta-analyses of all articles curated into the knowledge graph (Fig. 1)."
2a,"For example, rule marks with conditional opacity enable the overlaying of derived mechanical properties (tensile modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break) over representative curves showing raw tensile test data (Fig. 2a)."
2b,Using Vega-Lite transforms and layered rule marks permits the custom scaling and plotting of linearized Weibull distributions for real-time calculation of dielectric breakdown strength (Fig. 2b).
2c,A query of articles and the material systems studied within them offers an interactive view of trends in polymer nanocomposite materials research (Fig. 2c).
2d,Another meta-analysis demonstrates the results of entity resolution with the ChemProps API (Fig. 2d)34.

2f,"In addition to concatenated sub-views, sequence generators and Vega-Lite transforms make possible an embedded explanation of dynamic mechanical analysis for viscoelastic material properties atop experimental data (Fig. 2f)."
ALL_PANELS,"We identify two encoding channels in Vega-Lite that make the language well-suited to knowledge graphs: the url encoding channel for image marks (Fig. 3a), and the href (hyperlink reference) encoding channel for other data marks such as text (Fig. 3b) or point marks (Fig. 3c)."

–The need for health facilities to be able to assure 24-h cover, as large elements of maternity clinical presentations and care needs are unpredictable.


–Many life-threatening complications around the time of childbirth occur infrequently, so maintaining staff competence and confidence in dealing with them requires special planning, especially in facilities with a low annual number of births.


–To avoid ‘too much too soon, too little too late’ (2) in the provision of care, a high level of team capacity is needed, with competencies to identify and manage complications while having confidence to avoid unnecessary medicalization of uncomplicated labour, delivery and newborn care.


–As well as technical competence in the provision of care, maternity and newborn services need to be able to give consistent attention to the experience of care for women, their partners and families, in line with the Hulton and WHO frameworks for quality care (Figure 1) (3, 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"The World Health Organization Health Systems framework recognizes the Health Workforce as a building block contributing to outcomes of improved health, responsiveness, risk protection and efficiency (Figure 2) (5)."

ALL_PANELS,The introduction of semantic units adds further layers of triples to the well-established RDF and OWL layer for knowledge graphs (Fig. 1).
ALL_PANELS,"Bottom: The corresponding representation of the same statement as a semantic graph, adhering to RDF syntax and following the established pattern for measurement data from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) [35] of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO)Fig. 3."
ALL_PANELS,"This graph represents the same data statement as shown in Fig. 2 Top, but applies a semantic graph model that is based on the Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) [36], an ontology frequently used in the ecology communityTherefore, to maintain interoperability in the representation of empirical data statements within an RDF graph, it can be beneficial to restrict the graph patterns employed for their semantic modelling."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, metadata for a measurement may relate two distinct subgraphs: one representing the measurement itself (as seen in Fig. 2) and another documenting the underlying measuring process (as seen in Fig. 4)."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, the graph in Fig. 2 exemplifies a subgraph that can be organized in a semantic unit that instantiates the class *SEMUNIT:weight statement unit* as it is illustrated in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"This interconnectedness empowers users to make statements about the content encapsulated within the semantic unit’s data graph, as shown in Fig. 6."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, the weight measurement statement for apple X illustrated in Fig. 6 represents a statement unit."
ALL_PANELS,"Conversely, a weight measurement statement unit consists of a subject and two objects—the weight value and the weight unit (refer to Fig. 6)."
ALL_PANELS,"Examples encompass the weight measurement statement in Fig. 6 and statements like ‘This right hand has part this right thumb on January 29th 2022’, ‘Anna gives Bob a book’, and ‘Carla travels by train from Paris to Berlin on the 29th of June 2022’, each necessitating more than one triple."
ALL_PANELS,"In these cases, the statement’s verb or predicate is often represented not by a property within a single triple but instead by an instance resource, as exemplified by ‘weight X’ (PATO:0000128) in Fig. 6."
7a,"A named individual identification unit is a statement unit that serves to identify a resource to be a named individual, adding information such as the resource’s label, type, and its class membership (refer to Fig. 7A)."
7b,"A class identification unit2 is a statement unit that serves to identify a resource to be a class and provides details including its label, identifier, and optionally, the URIs of both the ontology and the specific version from which the class term has been imported (refer to Fig. 7B)."
ALL_PANELS,The connection between the resource representing the compound unit and those representing its associated semantic units is detailed through the property *SEMUNIT:hasAssociatedSemanticUnit* (see Fig. 8).
9a,"A typed statement unit is a compound unit comprising the following statement units (see Fig. 9A):

A statement unit that is not an instance of a named-individual or a class identification unit."
ALL_PANELS,"This typed statement unit consolidates the data graphs of six statement units, including the *’weight statement unit’* from Figure 6, serving as the reference statement unit for this *‘typed statement unit’*, and five instances of *SEMUNIT:named-individual identification unit*."
ALL_PANELS,A display pattern acts as a template that takes as input the labels provided by the identification units associated with a typed statement unit and generates a human-readable dynamic label for the textual (see Fig. 9B) or a dynamic mind-map pattern for the graphical representation (see Fig. 9C) of the statement of its reference statement unit.
ALL_PANELS,"For example, in documenting a research activity that results in the creation of a dataset describing the anatomy of a multicellular organism, the statement *‘description item unit’* isAbout
‘multicellular organism’ (UBERON:0000468) marks a transition in the frame of reference from the research activity’s outcome to the multicellular organism being described (see also Fig. 12 further below)."

ALL_PANELS,"Intersections between context units are discerned through is-about statements (see also Fig. 12), facilitating traversal across diverse frames of reference."
ALL_PANELS,"For instance, an item group unit focusing on the contents of a scholarly publication, can encapsulate information about the associated research activity, its inputs, outputs, research methods, and objectives (see Fig. 11)."

ALL_PANELS,"These findings will be discussed based on the context of the sound (see Figure 1) – that is, whether or not the auditory cues are naturalistic (i.e., relevant to the body and to movement, or its outcome) or non-naturalistic/artificial (e.g., sounds with semantic associations with movement, or its outcome, or else auditory cues that are unrelated) (Walker-Andrews, 1994)."

ALL_PANELS,"Specifically, shifting footstep sounds to higher frequencies caused participants to perceive their body as being lighter (vs. no sound and low frequency footstep sounds), and such perception was accompanied by increased emotional arousal (GSR) – see Figure 3."
ALL_PANELS,"The first found that when the sound of footsteps (i.e., naturalistic) was altered in frequency, with a high frequency sound inducing a feeling of lightness, participants perceived that they had walked more quickly than during low frequency alteration of footsteps or during a control condition where natural footstep sounds were provided (equally amplified across all frequency bands; see Figure 3) (Tajadura-Jiménez et al., 2015a)."
ALL_PANELS,"For example, when auditory cues are paired with a juggling task, there is an increased sensitivity to detect a gap in the auditory cue when compared with a rest (no movement) condition, but the opposite occurs for tactile cues: reduced sensitivity occurs during the movement (juggling) condition than during rest (see Figure 5) (Juravle and Spence, 2011)."

ALL_PANELS,"As illustrated by figure 1 (left), the distribution of trials funded by different types of organisations has changed over time."

6c,These integrations may have occurred on the att sequence located either at the left side or the right side of the LP sector (Fig. 6c).
6c,"Amplification with the first set of primers revealed integration on the left att sequence, while PCR products obtained with the second set reveals integration on the right att sequence (Fig. 6c)."
6d,"As expected, four of the integrants characterized revealed amplification with the second set of primers but not with the first set, indicating that integration indeed occurred on the rightmost att site (Fig. 6d)."
6d,"Interestingly, one of the fluorescent derivatives gave positive amplification with both primer sets, indicating the possibility of multiple integration events on the LP sector (Fig. 6d).Conclusions
As shown in this work, site-specific bacterial chromosome engineering mediated by IntA allows the efficient integration of sequences lacking extensive homology to the host genome, other than the att sequence."
