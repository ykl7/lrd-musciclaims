PMC10157366,"Using similar rescue experiments as for 766, we demonstrated that SMAP-061–mediated effects were directly dependent on PP2A modulation (Fig. 5F and G).",PMC10157366_figure_7,Figure 7.,"RAD51 inhibition leads to the chronic accumulation of γH2Ax and DNA errors inherent from genomic instability (GI), an ovarian cancer trait. HGSC cells harbor a high degree of GI that results in small nicks and breaks in the DNA over time. Sensor proteins such as γH2Ax are recruited to the site of damage to prevent DNA degradation and remain in check until a repair mechanism is triggered. The minimally functional HR machinery is activated and prompts the recruitment of the main downstream effector protein, RAD51, which by keeping those damaging signals at bay, allows cancer cells to survive, even if with relatively higher baseline levels of γH2Ax when compared with normal cells. For this reason, ovarian cancer cells are known to functionally tolerate and survive high baseline levels of DNA damage while avoiding apoptotic cues (left). When SMAP-061 is added to the cell, PP2A’s antitumor activity is functionally restored, and synthetic lethality is induced (right). RAD51 expression is inhibited by PP2A, preventing the HR output to be efficiently propagated. This results in the incapacity of the cells to repair their inherent DNA damage, thereby leading to the accumulation of γH2Ax signals in the nucleus, and ultimately, triggering apoptosis (schematic created with BioRender.com).",./data/PMC10157366/images/figure_7.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/88db/10157366/b961cc8a1949/599fig7.jpg,NEUTRAL

Lanes 1 and 15 contain a 1-kb DNA ladder. Lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 were run empty for spacing of experimental samples. Lane pairs (3/4, 6/7, 9/10, and 12/13) represent wild-type control, 7-RNAi-feed, 10-RNAi-feed, and 15-RNAi-feed SmedTV RNAi samples, respectively. The first lane of each pair contains the SmedTV reaction, and the piwi-3 positive control is in the second. Note that relative to the control (lane 3), the SmedTV band reduces until no longer detectable (lanes 6, 9, and 12), while the piwi-3 amplicon remains unchanged across all samples (lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13).

without a cap, the IVT mRNA would be recognized as foreign RNA by

its recognition by the host immune system and reduce immunogenicity
caused by mRNA molecule itself.77,80
The elongated
poly (A) tail at the 3′ end is important for the stability
and subsequent translation of mRNA.81 Incorporation
of UTR sequences enhances mRNA half-life and translation efficiency.82 For example, incorporating a human β-globin
UTR to both 5′- and 3′-UTR of the mRNA has been shown
to enhance the stability and translational efficiency,83 whereas insertion of an α-globin UTR to
the 3′-UTR region increased the mRNA stability.84 Both 3′- and 5′-UTR regions can
also inhibit decapping and degradation of mRNA.83,84 As such, sequence modifications in both 5′- and 3′-UTRs
have been explored to enhance the mRNA vaccine functionality.85
In addition, unmodified IVT mRNA sequences
can stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate the innate immune
system.86 To reduce immunogenicity of the
IVT mRNA, a variety of modified nucleotides have been introduced into
the ORF region.86,87 For instance, designed incorporation
of pseudouridine (ψ) (Figure 6) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve
translation.88 Additionally, mRNA containing
N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1ψ) (Figure 6) exhibited an increase

PMC8769369,"Domain-specific research into a handful of genes contributes to early-stage research
While approaches used within genome biology are well positioned to identify novel gene targets [29] (Fig 5A), we previously observed that early-stage research on recent gene targets differs from early-stage research on novel gene targets by further extending to journals dedicated to neurobiology and obesity (Fig 3).",PMC8769369_figure_4,Fig 6. Early-stage research focuses on a handful of genes and is driven by specific domains.,"(A) Cumulative distribution of pairs of highlighted genes and 2010 to 2018 publications highlighting recent gene targets (first highlighted 1 to 5 years before). The x-axis ranks genes by number of publications highlighting them, with rank 0 corresponding to the gene highlighted in the most publications. The y-axis tallies the percentage of all pairs of highlighted genes and 2010 to 2018 publications highlighting recent gene targets with a lower or equal rank. We emphasize in orange the top 1% genes (40 genes), which together account for 21% of all pairs. Note that for simplicity of data representation, we allow for overlapping and shifting time windows. For example, a gene that has been first highlighted 5 years prior the start the indicated decade would will only be represented by a single year in our analysis. (B) Letter plot of all highlighted genes reporting for each gene the total number of publications until 2018 for genes that still were a recent target during the time 2010 to 2018 period, but were not (“Not top 40,” blue) or were in the “top 40” (“Top 40,” orange) and “other” genes (gray). Area of boxes indicates share of values, with heights of boxes following letter style dimensions (innermost boxes contain 25 to 75 percentiles of values and subsequent boxes 12.75 to 87.5 percentiles of values, etc.). Note that for 2010 to 2018, “other” is practically synonymous with genes first highlighted before 2005. Note further that some the genes of the “Not top 40” category may still accrue more publications until 2018, the final year of our analysis given the presence of shifting time windows. (C) Journals that enrich for top recent gene targets preferentially highlight top 40 genes. Percentage of pairs of publications and recent gene targets that fall onto the top 40 recently highlighted genes. Journals are considered to disproportionally enrich for recent gene targets if they enrich for recent gene targets at least twice as much as they enrich for novel gene targets (above dashed line in Fig 3C). (D) Different top 40 genes are highlighted in publications from journals dedicated to different fields. The heatmap plot shows the percentage of publications highlighting a given recently highlighted gene from among all publications in the given journal. Shown are journals that highlight recent gene targets and enrich for recent gene targets at least twice as much as they enrich for novel gene targets (above dashed line in Fig 3C).

PMC7543167,"Boddy et al. hypothesize that cFMC may affect lactation, maternal thermoregulation, and mother–child bonding.6 Firstly, they cite a study showing that fetal microchimeric fibroblasts from mice differentiate into mammary epithelial cells when exposed to lactation hormones in vitro46 and another study showing that 56% of healthy parous women carry cFMC in their mammary tissue.47 Secondly, they present evidence that cFMC persists after pregnancy in maternal thyroid tissue48 and speculate that fetal cells may upregulate maternal body temperature in women with newborn infants.6 Finally, based on evidence that fetal cells in maternal mouse brains can differentiate into mature neurons49 and that cFMC may be found in the female human brain,50 they propose an evolutionary role for cFMC in strengthening the emotional tie between mother and child.6The impact of cFMC in inducing immunotolerance during pregnancy and temporary secondary effects on autoimmune disease
In addition to modulating maternal body function postpartum, maternal acquisition of fetal genetic material has been proposed to play a role in inducing materno-fetal tolerance during pregnancy, a factor potentially contributing to why certain autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are temporarily ameliorated during pregnancy.24 In 1993, a study by Nelson et al. looked into fetal–maternal disparity in HLA class II molecules,51 a concept illustrated in Figure 4.",PMC7543167_figure_3,Figure 3.,"Determining prevalence and quantity of fetal microchimerism. Using FISH or quantitative PCR, the prevalence and quantity of cFMC may be determined. The prevalence is obtained by identifying the number of women in each group that have detectable cFMC (individuals shown as shaded) relative to the number of women in each group in which cFMC is not detectable (individuals shown as unshaded) and comparing the two groups.

Action plan



What stands out? What do you notice about the whole map?
B

This is not a dense network
Much of the contact between network members is very infrequent (see Fig. 1)


Relationships need to be enhanced but members do not want more frequent meetings
Communication can improve by incorporating discussion of young parents’ needs into existing meetings



What do you notice about your organization and its relationship to other organizations?
B
Most collaboration occurs at less intensive levels (networking, cooperation)

More intensive levels of collaboration are not always needed for effective relationships
The Pathways project is an opportunity for network members to identify the most effective intensity of collaboration needed



Which organizations are ‘key players’?
C

This is a dense network; most organizations know each other (see all maps in Fig. 2)
High degree centralization means a small number of organizations are central to the network
Overall contact is infrequent and collaboration occurs at a lower intensity meaning fewer “key players.”

Note. Fig. 2 depicts the CONSORT flow diagram, outlining those assessed for eligibility, randomized, and included for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The number of those who dropped out, due to discontinuation or adverse event, and who did not complete pre- and/or post-assessments was recorded. Two participants discontinued in the MBCT-TiF arm for the following reasons: no longer eligible and time commitment issue. One adverse event (i.e., hospitalization) was reported in MBCT-TiF arm, which was deemed unrelated to the intervention. Two adverse events were reported in the CONTROL arm (i.e., cancer diagnoses) but were deemed unrelated to the intervention. Cohort 1 was recruited and enrolled in June 2021 and cohort 2 was recruited in September 2021 and enrolled in October 2021.
