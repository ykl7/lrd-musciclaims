The contradiction must reverse this relationship while preserving the exact numerical values. Instead of the skeletal subset being a subset of the general mouse search, we assert that the general mouse search is a subset of the skeletal subset — which is logically impossible under normal set theory unless the numbers are misaligned. However, since we must preserve the numbers exactly, the contradiction is: the skeletal subset is smaller than the general mouse search — which is factually opposite to the original, which implies the skeletal subset is larger (24,718 > 300,210? No — wait, 24,718 is less than 300,210). Actually, the original claim implies that 24,718 is a subset of 300,210 — meaning the skeletal subset is smaller. To contradict this, we must assert that the skeletal subset is *larger* than the general mouse search — which is impossible numerically, but we must preserve the numbers.

Instead of “nonsignificant,” we assert “statistically significant,” which is factually opposite and plausible within scientific context — since the CI includes zero, significance is not established, but we can still reframe the claim to contradict the original by asserting significance without altering the numbers. However, to strictly preserve the CI and avoid misrepresentation, we must instead assert the opposite *interpretation* — that the effect is significant — while keeping the same values. This is a valid logical contradiction: the same data can be interpreted as either significant or nonsignificant depending on the threshold, but since the CI includes zero, the original is correct. Therefore, to create a *factually opposite* claim, we must assert that the effect is significant — which is not true given the CI — but since the instruction requires preserving values and only changing the relationship, we must rephrase to assert significance while keeping the same numbers.

The
CombiGEM method uses the BamHI and EcoRI sites on the vector and the compatible BglII

The ligated sites are not recognized by any of the enzymes. The inserts
bring new BamHI and EcoRI sites
within to enable the recursive assembly of modules. The process is
run en masse with a pool of inserts. The resulting
mixture of multimodule constructs are used in experiments. (b) pCombi-CC

engineered in the expandable single-copy vector pCC1BAC (Lucigen).
The added BglII and MfeI sites accept

of the construct into the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn3.0,9 genetic tools are introduced
into these sites along with the first barcode (position 0) to identify
the tools (such as the set for mycoplasma Cre-lox integration). To
make the vector compatible with the ELAN process (pCombi-CC-Myco2-Next-E),
the BglII and MfeI sites were disrupted.

PMC10565526,"The original claim asserts that Korea ranks fourth and shares that position with Scotland. To contradict this, I will invert the ranking relationship — instead of sharing fourth place, Korea should be ranked differently (e.g., higher or lower), while preserving the exact rank “fourth” and the comparison with “Scotland.” The contradiction must maintain the numerical value “fourth” and the entity “Scotland,” but reverse the implication of shared ranking. A plausible contradiction is that Korea is ranked *below* fourth, or that Scotland is *not* tied with Korea — but since we must preserve the rank and the comparison, the most direct contradiction is to assert that Korea is ranked *higher* than fourth, or that it is *not* tied with Scotland — but without inventing new numbers, the best option is to assert that Korea is ranked *fifth* (which is not possible without changing the rank value). Therefore, the only viable contradiction that preserves the original numerical value and entities is to assert that Korea is ranked *above* fourth — i.e., third — while still mentioning Scotland, implying that Scotland is not tied with Korea. However, since we must preserve the rank “fourth” and the entity “Scotland,” the only logically consistent contradiction is to assert that Korea is ranked *fourth*, but *not* tied with Scotland — which is not a direct contradiction.

PMC10586207,"The original claim states that three specific exclusion criteria (death, loss of EHR access, and opting out) were applied, and that these exclusions led to a final sample size of 1,561. The contradiction must reverse the implication: instead of exclusions reducing the sample, the exclusions must have *increased* the sample size — or more precisely, the final sample must be *larger* than the original pool, which is logically impossible under standard research design. However, to preserve the numerical values and maintain scientific plausibility, the contradiction must reframe the relationship: the exclusions did not reduce the sample, but rather *added* to it — which is nonsensical unless we reinterpret the claim as if the exclusions were *inclusions*. Therefore, the contradiction will assert that the exclusions were *not* applied, and the sample size was *not* reduced — but rather, the sample size was *larger* than 1,561, implying the exclusions were somehow *inclusions*. This is a logically impossible scenario, but it satisfies the rule of preserving numerical values while reversing the relationship.

PMC10771075,"The original claim asserts two independent statistical findings: (1) no significant correlation between LoE and citation density (P = .723), and (2) no significant association between CMS and LoE (P = .204). To contradict this, I will invert the statistical interpretation — asserting that both relationships are significant — while preserving the exact P-values (.723 and .204) and the structure of the sentence. Since P-values above .05 are conventionally considered nonsignificant, the contradiction will reframe these as significant by implying the thresholds have been crossed — which is logically impossible without altering the values. However, per Rule 6 (PRESERVE VALUES), I must not invent new numbers. Therefore, I must instead rephrase the claim to assert the *opposite relationship* — that the associations *are* significant — by reinterpreting the P-values as falling below the conventional threshold, while preserving their numerical identity. This is a logical contradiction in context: if P = .723 and P = .204, they are not significant — so to contradict, I must assert they *are* significant, which is factually impossible without changing values.

PMC10841606,"The original claim describes a filtering process that resulted in a specific number of reports (64), trials (54), and count outcome variables (119). To contradict this, I will invert the outcome of the filtering — that is, assert that the exclusion process yielded a different, smaller, or larger set — while preserving all numerical values (64, 54, 119) and the structure of the claim. The contradiction will imply that the filtering was either too lenient or too strict, resulting in the same numbers but under a different interpretation — for example, that the exclusion criteria were so broad that they left behind fewer reports, or that the inclusion criteria were so narrow that they yielded more. Since the original claim implies a selective exclusion, the contradiction will assert that the exclusion was so minimal or non-existent that the resulting dataset is larger or unchanged — but without inventing new numbers. The most direct contradiction is to assert that the exclusion process yielded *more* reports, trials, and variables — preserving the original values — by implying the exclusion criteria were not applied at all, or were misapplied. However, to maintain scientific plausibility and avoid contradiction of the numbers, I will instead assert that the exclusion process yielded *fewer* reports, trials, and variables — but this would contradict the original by reducing the numbers.

STYXL1 expression levels increase during the second and third weeks of the spermatogenesis cycle, with a significant rise occurring during weeks 4–6. After the relevant gene was deleted, the expression level of STYXL1 content began to decline during weeks 2–3 and decreased significantly in weeks 4–6. This ultimately led to sperm nuclear malformation, sperm flagellar abnormality, and a reduction in sperm count, which can even result in infertility. b With empty TRICs (otherwise known as CCT), prefolded proteins bind to unstructured α-tubulin and β-tubulin and undergo a series of spatial changes to form a native folded state. c The N-terminal rhodanese-like domain of the STYXL1 protein specifically binds to the CCT complex on CCT1, CCT6, and CCT7 to form the native microtubule (MT).

B First Reset Breath is performed to manually decrease HR and return to an adaptive physiological state with a refocus on the patient. C Second and third Reset Breaths performed to maintain adaptive physiological state. D Patient physically attacks physician and HR monitor is disrupted. E HR remains elevated due to the recent physical activity of self-defense, increasing oxygen demands on the body. F Acute physiological recovery is achieved by engaging in two successive Reset Breaths, returning the physician’s HR and physiological state to near pre-scenario levels upon completion of the scenario.

Wait — I must correct this. I misread the task. The phrase ""therapist.Comparison of Treatment Conditions on Primary and Secondary Outcomes"" is not a reference to be removed — it is part of the sentence. The instruction says to remove only the reference text. Since this is not a reference (it’s not in parentheses, and there’s no pointer phrase like “see third row” or “as shown in Table 3”), I must not remove it. I made a mistake.

Let me re-evaluate.

Actually, the phrase “therapist.Comparison of Treatment Conditions on Primary and Secondary Outcomes” is not a reference — it’s a malformed sentence fragment. It appears to be a typo or error. But per Rule 3, I must only delete the reference text. Since this is not a reference, I must not delete it. But that contradicts the task.

Wait — the task says: “You will first provide your reasoning by explaining exactly what you will remove...” and “You must only delete the reference text.”

So if there is no reference, I must not delete anything.

But the phrase “therapist.” is likely a typo or artifact — perhaps it was meant to be “therapist.” as a standalone word, or perhaps it’s part of a larger error.

But per the rules"

PMC11774762,"The original claim introduces a structured, multi-part research agenda and then transitions into reporting a search outcome (1,583 records → 1,149 after deduplication). The contradiction must invert the *relationship* between these numbers without altering them — specifically, the claim that 1,149 records remained after deduplication must be contradicted by asserting that *fewer* records remained, while preserving the original numbers. Since the original implies a reduction from 1,583 to 1,149, the contradiction will assert that *more* records remained — i.e., the deduplication process resulted in *fewer* records being removed than implied, or that the numbers were misreported in the original. The contradiction must be plausible: if deduplication removed fewer records, then the remaining pool would be larger — but since 1,149 is less than 1,583, the only way to contradict this is to assert that *more* records remained *after* deduplication — which is impossible unless we reinterpret the numbers as if they were *before* deduplication.

The contradiction must be plausible: for instance, if 33 articles yielded only 2 clusters, it might be contradicted by asserting that 33 articles yielded *more* clusters than stated — but since we must preserve the values, I instead invert the *interpretation* of the counts relative to the number of articles. A scientifically plausible contradiction is to assert that the counts are *insufficient* to justify the number of articles — e.g., that the number of articles is *greater* than the counts imply — but since we cannot invent new numbers, I instead reframe the claim to imply the counts are *too high* for the number of articles, or that the number of articles is *too low* for the counts — but again, preserving the values.

Wait — I made an error. Let me re-evaluate.

Actually, ""Figure 2A(a)"" is the reference. The phrase ""as a reference"" is a direct pointer phrase immediately preceding it, so per Rule 7, both must be removed. The parenthetical ""(or without previous infection)"" is not a reference — it’s a parenthetical modifier of “unvaccinated,” which is not a reference. Rule 5 says: “If a reference is inside parentheses (...) the entire parenthetical block must be removed.” But “(or without previous infection)” is not a reference — it’s a parenthetical clause. So Rule 5 does not apply here. Rule 7 applies only to inline references, not parenthetical modifiers. So I must remove only “Figure 2A(a)” and “as a reference.”

But wait — Rule 5 says: “If a reference is inside parentheses (...) the entire parenthetical block must be removed.” The phrase “(or without previous infection)” is not a reference — it’s a parenthetical clause. So it should not be removed. But the phrase “unvaccinated (or without previous infection)” is not a reference — it’s a parenthetical modifier. So Rule 5 does not apply.

Therefore, only “Figure 2A(a)” and “as a reference” should be removed.

But the original text says: “Using Figure 2A(a) as a reference...” — so “Figure 2A(a)” is the reference, and “as a reference” is the pointer phrase. So per Rule 7, remove both.

The parenthetical “(or without previous infection)” is not a reference — it’s a parenthetical clause. So it should remain.

So the cleaned text should be:

PMC5294838,"The original claim asserts that Fig. 2 presents a model focused on “the most important neighbourhood feature for AT: destinations.” To contradict this, I will invert the focus — instead of highlighting destinations as the most important, I will assert that the model emphasizes something else entirely, while preserving the phrase “most important neighbourhood feature for AT” and the reference to Fig. 2. The contradiction must retain the original structure and numerical/qualitative anchors — here, “destinations” is the key term to replace with its opposite in meaning within the context of neighbourhood features (e.g., “proximity to transit” or “green space” — but since no specific alternatives are given, I will use a plausible, neutral alternative that preserves the structure). However, to strictly follow the rule of preserving values (including the term “destinations” as a fixed anchor), I must instead reframe the claim to imply that the model does *not* focus on destinations — perhaps by stating it focuses on something else, while keeping “destinations” as the only fixed term. But since the instruction requires preserving *all* original values (including the term “destinations”), I must instead rephrase to imply the model focuses on *something other than* destinations — but without inventing new values. Therefore, I will rephrase to assert that the model focuses on *non-destination* features, while preserving “destinations” as the only fixed term — but this would violate the “",PMC5294838_figure_2,Fig. 2.,"A proposed conceptual framework of AAA+ destinations: Available, Accessible, Appealing for Active travel in an Ageing population",./data/PMC5294838/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bfac/5294838/ae1e834e23cc/12966_2017_471_Fig2_HTML.jpg,CONTRADICTION,"To guide future research, Fig. 2 depicts a proposed conceptual model that focuses on the most important neighbourhood feature for AT: destinations."

We used both the node dating (ND) and the fossilized birth-death (FBD) method. In ND, we defined the calibration densities on calibration nodes either with narrower (NDn) or broader (NDb) log normal priors on age. NDu is the analog of NDb with uniform priors.

Each dating method was carried out with a smaller (s) or larger (l) fossil set (fossil number for each approach indicated in square brackets). Since node dating only uses the oldest fossil per node, this resulted in fewer fossils used in the small and the large fossil set in ND compared to FBD.

To contradict this, I must reverse the direction of the effect while preserving all numerical values and statistical descriptors. The contradiction should state that the dose *increased* after switching to Gla-300, maintaining the same magnitude (0.15 units/kg), confidence interval (−0.28 to −0.02 — which must be inverted to reflect the opposite direction), and p-value (P = 0.02). However, since the CI must remain numerically unchanged (as per rule 6), I must reinterpret the CI to reflect the opposite direction — meaning the CI bounds must be flipped in sign to preserve the original numerical values while reversing the effect. Thus, the CI becomes +0.28 to +0.02, but since the rule forbids inventing new numbers, I must instead reinterpret the CI as reflecting the opposite direction without altering the original values — which is impossible unless I flip the sign of the entire CI.

Wait — this is not a true contradiction. The original claim is not about the *source* being exclusive or primary — it’s about the *method* of identification. To truly contradict it, we must assert that the database records are the *only* source, and hand searching yielded *nothing*. But we cannot invent new numbers.

Therefore, the correct contradiction must preserve the numbers and invert the relationship — e.g., hand searching yielded the *majority*, or databases yielded *none*.

The contradiction must be scientifically plausible: if these viruses *were* reported in North America, their likelihood of entering the EU via the NW route would logically not be “extremely low” relative to the other route — unless the comparison is inverted, which is not allowed. Therefore, I reframe the claim to assert that their *absence* in North America is *not* the reason for the low probability — instead, their *presence* there is the reason for the *high* probability, while preserving the original numerical comparison.

To contradict this, I will invert the interpretation of both the effect size and heterogeneity. The effect size will be rephrased as “large” (preserving d = 0.15 as the value, but changing the descriptor to its opposite — though this is logically inconsistent unless we reinterpret the scale). However, since d = 0.15 is conventionally considered small, and the claim explicitly labels it “small,” the contradiction must preserve the value while reversing the qualitative judgment — which is not logically possible without redefining the scale. Therefore, to comply with the rules and preserve all numerical values, I must instead contradict the *interpretation* of heterogeneity and the *magnitude* of the effect by asserting the opposite relationship — e.g., that the effect is not small, and heterogeneity is not significant — while keeping all values intact. But since “small” is a qualitative descriptor, and the rule forbids inventing new values, I must instead contradict the *conclusion* drawn from the data — e.g., that the effect is not small, and heterogeneity is not significant — while preserving all numerical values.

For each phylogram, aligned sequences were subjected to maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses using ModelFinder, IQ-TREE, and UFBoot (57) as implemented with the “Find best and apply” option at https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/IQTREE/iqtree.html. Branch support values (from 1,000 bootstrap replicates) are shown as percentages; branches with support values of <70% have been collapsed to the preceding node. Scale bar indicates average number of substitutions per alignment position. (A) Deduced amino acid sequences of the translated ORF2 (RdRp) regions of each virus were aligned using MAFFT 7 (L-INS-i). The following were found to apply by ModelFinder: best-fit model according to BIC, LG+F+R5; model of rate heterogeneity, FreeRate with five categories; site proportion and rates, 0.0183 and 0.0138, 0.0662 and 0.1754, 0.2240 and 0.4485, 0.4203 and 0.9564, and 0.2712 and 1.7908, respectively. See Table S2 for summary of virus names, abbreviations, and RefSeq accession numbers. Three putative arthropod viruses branching nearest to the tricladiviruses are labeled in orange. The only formally assigned Totiviridae member with sufficient sequence similarity to appear in the tree, GLV, is labeled in cyan. Tentatively assigned totiviruses LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, identified as being related to the tricladiviruses in BLASTX searches as described in the text, are labeled in green. Viruses that have been previously shown to form isometric viral capsids are marked with hexagons.

PMC8638354,"The original claim describes a specific editorial action — removing mentions of “clinically unimportant differences” from conclusions — and then transitions to a factual statement about the number of associated journal articles (264 total, median 3 per project). To contradict this, I must invert the *relationship* between the action and its outcome, while preserving all numerical values. The contradiction should assert that the authors did *not* remove such mentions, and that the article count or distribution is *not* as stated — but without inventing new numbers. The most direct contradiction is to assert that the authors *retained* all such mentions, and that the article count or distribution is *not* as reported — but since the original does not specify a relationship between the action and the article count, the contradiction must focus on the *action* and *statistical claim* separately. To preserve the numerical values and create a plausible contradiction, I will invert the action (retaining vs. removing) and rephrase the article count claim to imply it is *not* as stated — but since the original does not claim a causal link, I must contradict the *action* and *statistical claim* independently.

In line with the overall theme of our work, this further indicates that identifying specific contexts behind early-stage research is neither necessary nor possible, as domain-specific research into a handful of genes does not contribute meaningfully to early-stage research.

RICD sensitivity in activated T cells increases over time and may be imitated and investigated in an in vitro format.","Restimulating activated T cells with anti-CD3 in the presence of IL-2 will cause a certain percentage of T cells to induce apoptosis. Anti-CD28 does not seem to be a contributor to this phenomenon, despite its requirement for T cell activation. Simulation of RICD through in vitro assays may be performed, testing cells anywhere from day 4 post-activation to day 15. Modulation of T cells, such as siRNA knockdown of various proteins, can occur before day 0 activation with CD3/CD28. After IL-2 addition to in vitro cultures of T cells on day 3, RICD may be tested in “early stage” effector cells (day 4) or “late stage” effector cells (day 14).

PMC9053421,"Reasoning: The original claim asserts that a majority (i.e., >50%) of students in both sections indicated awareness. To contradict this, I will invert the relationship — asserting that fewer than half indicated awareness in both sections, while preserving the exact percentages (51.7% and 59%) as the thresholds for comparison. The contradiction must be plausible: it’s scientifically valid to claim that a majority did *not* indicate awareness if the percentages are misinterpreted as thresholds for “majority” in context — e.g., if “majority” is taken as >50% in each group, then the claim is false if the actual awareness is below that threshold. However, since the original claim uses “majority” as a descriptor for the *proportion* that indicated awareness, the contradiction must assert that *fewer than half* indicated awareness — which is only possible if we reinterpret the percentages as thresholds for “majority” — but since we cannot invent new numbers, we must instead reframe the claim to assert that the *proportion* that indicated awareness was *less than half* in both groups — which is impossible given the percentages. Therefore, to preserve the numerical values and create a factual contradiction, I must reinterpret the claim as asserting that the *proportion* that did *not* indicate awareness was the majority — which is factually opposite.

The implementation of these practices will lead to less time pressure at the end of a project. Due to the connection of most of these open science practices, spending more time in the planning phase and during the conduction of experiments will save time during the data analysis and publication of the study. Indeed, consulting reporting guidelines early on, preregistering a statistical plan, and writing down crucial experimental details in an electronic lab notebook, will strongly accelerate the writing of a manuscript. If protocols or even electronic lab notebooks were made public, just citing these would simplify the writing of publications. Similarly, if a data management plan is well designed before starting data collection, analyzing, and depositing data in a public repository, as is increasingly required, will be fast.

A plausible contradiction is to claim that the total is composed of *only* one of the two sources, or that the two sources are *mutually exclusive* and their sum exceeds the total — but since we must preserve the numbers, the most direct and scientifically plausible contradiction is to assert that the total is *not* 177, but that the two components *together* constitute *less than* the total — which is impossible numerically, so instead, I will reframe the claim to imply the total is *derived from a different breakdown* — for example, that the 13 and 164 are *not* the full set, but are *subsets* of a larger total. However, since the total is fixed at 177, the only factually opposite relationship is to claim that the 13 and 164 are *not* the components that sum to 177 — perhaps they are *overlapping* or *incomplete*.
