PMC4874504,CASL Club sessions were designed to achieve these goals (Fig. 1).,PMC4874504_figure_1,Figure 1. Specific tools and skills were introduced during each session to help students achieve the three objectives of CASL Club.,Workshop sessions were designed around the three objectives. Objective-specific tools were introduced and skills were practiced over the eight hour-long sessions.,./data/PMC4874504/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ed8b/4874504/a44a2a541a67/nihms784497f1.jpg
