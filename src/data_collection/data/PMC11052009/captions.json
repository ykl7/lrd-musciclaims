Among the 23 Thermus strains, eight strains are not included in our microbial denitrification potential dataset because they do not have at least one of the genes for the 12 enzymes for denitrification. In the categorization by Jiao et al. [63], the filled symbols indicate presence of genes for denitrification enzymes. The numbers before the Genome Name in both images is to show agreement of absence of genes for the denitrification enzymes by the categorizations by Isokpehi et al. (2024) and Jiao et al. [63]. In addition, the list of Thermus strains include Type strains (with superscript “T”).
