  "figure_1": "(A) Experimental setup. Two robot arms apply touches to both rubber hands placed on top of the table, and one robot arm applies touches to the participant’s real hand, which is hidden below the platform. A white fixation dot is located halfway between the two rubber hands. (B) Trial schematics. The robot arms tap the rubber hands and the real hand with different degrees of asynchrony between the rubber hands; crucially, one rubber hand is always synchronously tapped with the real hand, which is the condition that we know produces the strongest RHI. Next, an auditory cue informs participants that they must verbally indicate which hand felt most like their own (left or right). An auditory cue informs them when the next trial is about to begin. (C) Texture congruency conditions. The materials touching the rubber hands and the real hand are manipulated such that the material touching the rubber hands and the real hands are the same (both textures congruent), such that only the material touching the right rubber hand and the real hand are the same (left texture incongruent), or such that only the material touching the left rubber hand and the real hand are the same (right texture incongruent). The arrows and colour of the robot arms’ tips represent the texture congruence conditions. The robot arms’ tips are represented in different colours for didactic purposes, but they did not differ visually in the setup. Illustration by Mattias Karlén."
