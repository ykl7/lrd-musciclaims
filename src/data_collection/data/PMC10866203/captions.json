  "figure_1": "Emergency department (ED) visits and 28-day mortality at all Hong Kong public hospital EDs during 2016 to 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-2021). (A) Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and (B) official COVID-19 mortality, with waves shaded pink. Waves are defined by government-mandated tightening or relaxation of antipandemic measures. (C) Average daily ED visits and (D) 28-day deaths from 2016 to 2019. (E) Daily ED visits and (F) 28-day deaths in 2020 and 2021.",
  "figure_2": "Seasonally adjusted changes in Hong Kong public hospital emergency department visits and 28-day mortality, segmented by age and sex, from 2016 to 2019 and in 2020 and 2021, per wave period and yearly. (A) Line plots of seasonally adjusted visit change percentage among age and sex groups across waves, with after-wave periods shown by dashed lines (see Methods). The seasonally adjusted visit change percentage is calculated as the same-period change percentage against the 2016 to 2019 average. (B) Emergency department visits and excess 28-day deaths across age strata with percentage changes between 2020 and the 2016 to 2019 average, as well as 2021 vs the 2016 to 2019 average. Numerical values are percentage changes from the 2016 to 2019 average to the annual sum of each year (2020 and 2021). (C) Line plots of excess 28-day mortality per 100 reduced emergency department visits among 45-54, 55-64, and ≥65 year age groups and sex groups (95% CIs are shown by the shaded areas) across 0-to-14-day delays. This was estimated by instrumental variable analysis, with wave and after-wave periods as instrument variables, emergency department attendance as exposure, and emergency department 28-day deaths as outcome.",
  "figure_3": "Seasonally adjusted change (vs 2016-2019 average) in public hospital emergency department visits across waves, with the after-wave period in dashed lines.",
  "figure_4": "Seasonally adjusted change in episode admission among people aged ≥65 years by comorbidity and 28-day all-cause mortality, as well as absolute yearly change in 28-day mortality, vs the 2016-2019 average in 2020 wave and nonwave periods. The blue line is the 1:1 visit and death change line, on which high mortality-rate situations like cardiac arrest and sudden death normally fall. Deaths on arrival/deaths before arrival were excluded. Comorbidities were defined by the Charlson comorbidities. CHF: congestive heart failure; DM: diabetes mellitus; MI: myocardial infarction; PUD: peptic ulcer disease; PVD: peripheral vascular disease."
