PMC10936517,"This is known as the context, mechanism and outcomes configuration (CMOC).49 The ontological core of realism is that the real, whether that is physical or social, exists independently of our knowledge of it;50 however, we can come to know them by observing sequences of events and identifying the mechanisms which give rise to different outcomes.50

Realist research is theory driven, with the unit of analysis being the programme theory rather than programme activities.48 In realist research, the programme is seen as a dynamic mini-system within a larger complex social world.50 The enquiry of the research is to build and then test an account, or accounts, of how and why an intervention works.50

When reporting on this realist synthesis, we shall follow the steps outlined in RAMESES (Realist and MEta-Narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards) guide for meta-narrative synthesis.51
