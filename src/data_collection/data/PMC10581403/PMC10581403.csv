Water-APT guides the user through several steps (Fig. 1) to complete the MCDA methodology and achieve the goal of ranking of remediation technologies for each evaluated contamination site.",PMC10581403_figure_1,"Fig.
1.","Logic Flow of Water-APT. Information inputs into the decision process are shown at the top of the figure. Information from the inputs flows into the shaded area which encloses the steps in the AHP implementation of Water-APT. The output of the AHP process then feeds into the decision objective, which is selection of the remediation technology.",./data/PMC10581403/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/360a/10581403/65bcd950c0ff/nihms-1924903-f0001.jpg
