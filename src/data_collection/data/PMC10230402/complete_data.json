(A) T\n1 weighted anatomical image (3D SPGR, TR/TE = 10/1.27 ms, FA = 18°). (B) Corresponding quantitative T\n1 map derived using the variable flip angle methodology from image A and a corresponding proton density weighted image (not shown, acquired with same parameters but FA = 2°). (C) Oxygen induced ΔT\n1 map obtained following a supplemental oxygen challenge administered using 15 L/min oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Within the highlighted malignant nodal mass, regions of oxygen induced T\n1 shortening implying normoxia are clearly seen. Distinct oxygen refractory regions are also identifiable which imply either hypoxic or non-perfused areas. FA, flip angle; TE, echo time; TR, repetition time.",
