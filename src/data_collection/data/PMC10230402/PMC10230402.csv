PMC10230402,"By administering high concentration oxygen and performing T1 mapping, areas of hypoxia can be identified from a lack of decrease in T1 times (Figure 1).",PMC10230402_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Example images from a patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma illustrating the difference between conventional T
1 weighted imaging, quantitative T
1 mapping and oxygen induced quantitative ΔT
1 maps. (A) T
1 weighted anatomical image (3D SPGR, TR/TE = 10/1.27 ms, FA = 18°). (B) Corresponding quantitative T
1 map derived using the variable flip angle methodology from image A and a corresponding proton density weighted image (not shown, acquired with same parameters but FA = 2°). (C) Oxygen induced ΔT
1 map obtained following a supplemental oxygen challenge administered using 15 L/min oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Within the highlighted malignant nodal mass, regions of oxygen induced T
1 shortening implying normoxia are clearly seen. Distinct oxygen refractory regions are also identifiable which imply either hypoxic or non-perfused areas.
