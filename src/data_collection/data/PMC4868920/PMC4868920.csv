PMC4868920,"This may be also due to the majority of participants having used up all the available time to solve the hacking challenge, with considerably reduced variability in the hacking time data compared to the hacking level data.Figure 3.",PMC4868920_figure_3,Figure 3.,Scatterplots showing the non-significant correlations between Attention to Detail and hacking performance (ps > 0.17).
