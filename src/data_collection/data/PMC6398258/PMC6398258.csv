The figure illustrates the central position of permission surrounded by the five context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs 1–5). The solid arrows are the relationship of permission to each CMOC. The broken lines represent the interactions between individual CMOCs. Note that most of these interactions are bi-directional,./data/PMC6398258/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a42a/6398258/029631c5b1d0/12916_2019_1286_Fig2_HTML.jpg
