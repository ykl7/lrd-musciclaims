  "figure_1": "Differences in time spent on research by gender. Differences in male and female time spent on research per biweekly period, controlling for variance at the level of the institution. Lines represent males’ and females’ levels of confidence in designing experiments, as indicated. Interactions with this variable were significant only for males. Estimated effect sizes between males and females by time point for T9–T15 ranged between Cohen’s d = 0.63 and d = 1.7."
