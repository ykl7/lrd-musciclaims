PMC4914811,"When all the professions were combined, the rates of international collaboration steadily rose over the 3‐year period from 7.2% to 10.3% (see Fig. 1).",PMC4914811_figure_1,Figure 1.,Interval plot of international collaboration rate for all health occupations sampled by year. This figure demonstrates the overall change in international collaboration seen across the allied health occupations over the 3‐year period studied. 95% confidence interval for the mean. The pooled standard deviations were used to calculate the intervals.,./data/PMC4914811/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2c2b/4914811/adc99a1cd7a9/JMRS-63-075-g001.jpg
