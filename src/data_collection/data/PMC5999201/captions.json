  "figure_2": "Ragweed fruit surface texture is highly variable, as illustrated here with two representative samples. Surface texture was quantified using two indices, each of which is based on the outline of an individual fruit and the convex hull subsuming that outline. Convexity is calculated as convex hull perimeter/fruit perimeter, and solidity is calculated as the fruit area/convex hull area; both indices are bounded by 0 and 1, with large values indicating relatively little surface texture. In the examples shown here, the fruit on the left is more textured (solidity = 0.813 and convexity = 0.791) than the fruit on the right (solidity = 0.932 and convexity = 0.949)",
