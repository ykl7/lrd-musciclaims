PMC6909195,Figure 1 illustrates this with a toy simulation of a set of studies testing a difference between means from two conditions.,PMC6909195_figure_1,Figure 1.,"The impact of publication bias demonstrated with plots of cumulative log odds in favour of true versus null effect over a series of experiments. The log odds for each experiment can be computed with knowledge of alpha (.05) and power (.8); 1 denotes an experiment with significant difference between means, and 0, a null result. The starting point is zero, indicating that we assume a 50:50 chance of a true effect. For each significant result, the log odds of it coming from a true effect versus a null effect is log(.8/.05) = 2.77. For a null result, the log odds is log (.2/.95) = −1.55. The selected set of studies in panel (a) concludes with a log odds greater than 3, indicating that the likelihood of a true effect is 20 times greater than a null effect. However, panel (b), which includes additional null results (labelled in grey), leads to the opposite conclusion.",./data/PMC6909195/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e321/6909195/d6f087fd57fb/10.1177_1747021819886519-fig1.jpg

You are asked to test the hypothesis that—for these 4 cards—if an even number appears on one side, then the opposite side is red. Which card(s) would you turn over to test the hypothesis?”",./data/PMC6909195/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e321/6909195/58e42916d5b0/10.1177_1747021819886519-fig2.jpg
PMC6909195,"When dealing with probabilistic phenomena, a Bayesian approach makes more sense, whereby we consider the accumulated evidence to determine the relative likelihood of one hypothesis over another (as illustrated in Figure 1).",PMC6909195_figure_1,Figure 1.,"The impact of publication bias demonstrated with plots of cumulative log odds in favour of true versus null effect over a series of experiments.

PMC6909195,"About the same (that is, within 5% of each other)

Most people selected Option 3, whereas, as illustrated in Figure 3, Option 2 is the correct answer—with only 15 births per day, the day-to-day variation in the proportion of boys will be much higher than with 45 births per day, and hence, more days will have more than 60% boys.",PMC6909195_figure_3,Figure 3.,Simulated data showing proportions of males born in a small hospital with 15 births per day versus a large hospital with 45 births per day.

PMC6909195,"Further evidence of the cumulative impact of citation bias is shown in Figure 4, which uses studies of intervention for depression.",PMC6909195_figure_4,Figure 4.,"The cumulative impact of reporting and citation biases on the evidence base for antidepressants. (a) Displays the initial, complete cohort of trials that were recorded in a registry, while (b) through (e) show the cumulative effect of biases. Each circle indicates a trial, while the colour indicates whether results were positive or negative or were reported to give a misleadingly positive impression(spin). Circles connected by a grey line indicate trials from the same publication. The progression from (a) to (b) shows that nearly all the positive trials but only half of those with null results were published, and reporting of null studies showed (c) bias or (d) spin in what was reported. In (e), the size of the circle indicates the (relative) number of citations received by that category of studies.
