      "caption": "The impact of publication bias demonstrated with plots of cumulative log odds in favour of true versus null effect over a series of experiments. The log odds for each experiment can be computed with knowledge of alpha (.05) and power (.8); 1 denotes an experiment with significant difference between means, and 0, a null result. The starting point is zero, indicating that we assume a 50:50 chance of a true effect. For each significant result, the log odds of it coming from a true effect versus a null effect is log(.8/.05) = 2.77. For a null result, the log odds is log (.2/.95) = −1.55. The selected set of studies in panel (a) concludes with a log odds greater than 3, indicating that the likelihood of a true effect is 20 times greater than a null effect. However, panel (b), which includes additional null results (labelled in grey), leads to the opposite conclusion.",
