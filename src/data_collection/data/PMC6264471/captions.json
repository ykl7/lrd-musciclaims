  "figure_1": "Total count (A) and abundance (B) of peptides identified in unfortified human milk and preterm infant gastric digests of fortified human milk from either bovine milk proteins, human milk proteins or either of the two. The graph is divided into sections of different shades of grey (from black to light grey) for the number of infants the peptides were identified in. Black represents peptides only identified in one infant and the lightest shade of grey representing peptide found in all 5 infants. Results are shown as mean ± standard error.",
  "figure_2": "Relative count (A) and relative ion intensity (B) of peptides identified in human milk and preterm infants gastric from either bovine milk proteins (bovine), human milk proteins (human), sorted according to the total peptide release among all samples. Results are shown as mean ± standard error. CASB, β-casein; OSTP, osteopontin; CASA1, αs1-casein; PIGR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; CEL, bile salt-activated lipase; BT1A1, butyrophilin subfamily 1 member A1; TRFL, lactoferrin; CASK, κ-casein; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase; LALBA, α-lactalbumin.",
  "figure_3": "Mean relative count of (A) P1 and (B) P1’ positions of human and bovine milk protein-derived peptides identified in five human milk and infant gastric samples distributed by amino acid.",
