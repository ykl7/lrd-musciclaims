PMC8461675,Figure 1 displays a PRISMA Flow Diagram for the present study.,PMC8461675_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"PRISMA Flow Diagram for the systematic review of PubMed articles related to AD APOE. The PRISMA flow diagram represents the systematic review of PubMed articles and the compilation and curation of journal article data into a manually constructed relational database. The final set of included studies comprised 31 journal articles and 3,045 mice. Features assessed include mouse genotype (wild type, APOE2 knock-in, APOE3 knock-in, APOE4 knock-in, APOE knock-out); type of external APOE modulatory treatment and its intended impact on the underlying etiology and corresponding cognition (positive treatment, negative treatment, untreated); mouse age (in days); and mouse gender (male, female, or mixed/unknown).",./data/PMC8461675/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3cee/8461675/fb93c4f0b65b/jad-83-jad210492-g001.jpg
PMC8461675,Figure 2 illustrates the mean escape latency in seconds for each untreated group (t0) with the error bars denoting the corresponding positive standard deviation.,PMC8461675_figure_2,Fig. 4.,"Importance of binomial features on normalized and standardized Morris Water Maze (MWM) escape latency as predicted by supervised random forest modeling. Data was randomly partitioned into a training set (80%) and an independent test set (20%). Overall model accuracy during independent testing was 82%. Twelve binary features were utilized to predict escape latency; thus, each feature was marked for each mouse as being either present or absent. In descending order, the importance of the following binary features was predicted for classifying “superior” cognition: [KI3, age, g_m, KI4, t0, t+, KO, WT, g_mi, t–, g_f, KI2] = [0.270, 0.094, 0.092, 0.088, 0.077, 0.074, 0.069, 0.061, 0.058, 0.054, 0.038, 0.023]. Superior cognition was defined as a standardized and normalized MWM escape latency less than or equal to the overall sample mean (see Methods). Feature legend is as follows: transgenic APOE3 knock-in (KI3), male gender (g_m), transgenic APOE4 knock-in (KI4), untreated (t0), positive treatment meant to enhance cognition (t+), transgenic APOE knockout (KO), wild type (WT), mixed or unknown gender (g_mi), negative treatment (t–), female gender (g_f), and transgenic APOE2 knock-in (KI2). The overall sample size for the supervised random forest model was n = 3,045 mice. There were 1,430 female mice, 1,181 male mice, and 258 mixed/unknown gender mice.
