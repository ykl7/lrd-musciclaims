Features assessed include mouse genotype (wild type, APOE2 knock-in, APOE3 knock-in, APOE4 knock-in, APOE knock-out); type of external APOE modulatory treatment and its intended impact on the underlying etiology and corresponding cognition (positive treatment, negative treatment, untreated); mouse age (in days); and mouse gender (male, female, or mixed/unknown).",

Data was randomly partitioned into a training set (80%) and an independent test set (20%). Overall model accuracy during independent testing was 82%. Twelve binary features were utilized to predict escape latency; thus, each feature was marked for each mouse as being either present or absent. In descending order, the importance of the following binary features was predicted for classifying “superior” cognition: [KI3, age, g_m, KI4, t0, t+, KO, WT, g_mi, t–, g_f, KI2] = [0.270, 0.094, 0.092, 0.088, 0.077, 0.074, 0.069, 0.061, 0.058, 0.054, 0.038, 0.023]. Superior cognition was defined as a standardized and normalized MWM escape latency less than or equal to the overall sample mean (see Methods). Feature legend is as follows: transgenic APOE3 knock-in (KI3), male gender (g_m), transgenic APOE4 knock-in (KI4), untreated (t0), positive treatment meant to enhance cognition (t+), transgenic APOE knockout (KO), wild type (WT), mixed or unknown gender (g_mi), negative treatment (t–), female gender (g_f), and transgenic APOE2 knock-in (KI2). The overall sample size for the supervised random forest model was n = 3,045 mice. There were 1,430 female mice, 1,181 male mice, and 258 mixed/unknown gender mice. The breakdown of mouse genotype sample sizes is given in Table 1.",
