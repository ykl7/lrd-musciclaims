  "figure_1": "Overall compliance percentage as a function of year of publication of organismal animal physiology articles (n = 84) published in five different journals: Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B, Journal of Physiology, Journal of Experimental Biology, American Journal of Physiology—Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative, and Frontiers in Physiology. See methods for additional details. Capital letters indicate significant differences among years. Mean value for decade group 2018–2020 (n = 45) is significantly higher than decade group 2008–2010 (n = 39; P = 0.001).",
  "figure_2": "Overall reporting compliance of 34 commonly reported experimental variables, from highest to lowest compliance relative to mean compliance of ∼63%. Data are grouped into data collection variables (gray), innate biological variables (red), and experimental condition variables (blue) and are likely to affect physiological processes and, consequently, the reported results. Note that 11 of 13 variables with less than average compliance involved factors potentially affecting the physiology of the study subject."
