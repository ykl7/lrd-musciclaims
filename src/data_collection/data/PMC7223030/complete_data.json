Solid black curves represent values using the standard approach that ignores misclassification, dotted curves represent values obtained by plugging in estimated values of  and  into Equation (1) and ignoring uncertainty in the estimation of  and , and the dashed curves represent values obtained using the proposed approach, including bootstrapping of the validation and main study data. The plot of (B) 95% confidence interval coverage also contains a grey reference line at 95%",
