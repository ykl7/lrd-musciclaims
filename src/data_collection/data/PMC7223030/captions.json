  "figure_1": "(A) Standard error and (B) 95% confidence interval coverage in simulations with nondifferential misclassification in which a = 0.1 and b = 0.3 under various sizes of the external validation data set. Solid black curves represent values using the standard approach that ignores misclassification, dotted curves represent values obtained by plugging in estimated values of  and  into Equation (1) and ignoring uncertainty in the estimation of  and , and the dashed curves represent values obtained using the proposed approach, including bootstrapping of the validation and main study data. The plot of (B) 95% confidence interval coverage also contains a grey reference line at 95%",
  "figure_2": "Estimated cumulative incidence of mortality and loss to care and pointwise 95% confidence intervals over 1 year after enrollment in the FACES program in western Kenya between 2001 and 2011 under the standard approach to estimate cumulative incidence  (dashed lines) and the proposed approach  (solid lines)"
