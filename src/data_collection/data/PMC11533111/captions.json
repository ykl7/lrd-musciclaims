  "figure_1": "Graphical abstract of the research question and workflow in the current study. (a) (also shown with violet letters): information regarding notably the mathematical model description. The model diagram is shown (left), where, Atissue and Ctissue represent the amount (mg) and the concentration of chemical in a tissue (mg/kg), respectively. Dose is the intravenous infusion of chemical (mg/min). QC is the cardiac output (L/min). Qtissue is the blood flow (L/min) to a tissue. PCtissue is the partition coefficient (L/kg) of the chemical between a tissue and the blood. ERliver is the extraction ratio of the chemical in the liver (unitless). (b) (also shown with green letters): information regarding the model implementation (code). A screenshot with part of the SBML code is shown (center), and the model simulation figure (right). As an example, the same exposure scenario as by Upton et al. [32] was considered.",
  "figure_2": "Diagram of the conceptual PBPK mathematical model, adapted from the conceptual model by Upton et al. (2016), with the differences explained in the Material and methods. A is the amount of the chemical in a given compartment (mg). Cblood, Cliver, and Cothers are the concentrations of the chemical in the blood (mg/L), liver and other body tissues (mg/kg), respectively. Dose is the intravenous infusion of the drug (mg/min). QC is the cardiac output (L/min). Qothers and Qliver_total are the blood flows (L/min) to other body tissues and to the liver, respectively. PCothers and PCliver are the partition coefficients (L/kg) of the chemical in other body tissues and the liver, respectively. ERliver is the extraction ratio of the chemical in the liver (unitless). The parameter values are shown in Tables 2 and 3."
