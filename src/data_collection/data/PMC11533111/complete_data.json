(a) (also shown with violet letters): information regarding notably the mathematical model description. The model diagram is shown (left), where, Atissue and Ctissue represent the amount (mg) and the concentration of chemical in a tissue (mg/kg), respectively. Dose is the intravenous infusion of chemical (mg/min). QC is the cardiac output (L/min). Qtissue is the blood flow (L/min) to a tissue. PCtissue is the partition coefficient (L/kg) of the chemical between a tissue and the blood. ERliver is the extraction ratio of the chemical in the liver (unitless). (b) (also shown with green letters): information regarding the model implementation (code). A screenshot with part of the SBML code is shown (center), and the model simulation figure (right). As an example, the same exposure scenario as by Upton et al. [32] was considered.",
