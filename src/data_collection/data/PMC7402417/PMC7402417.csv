The study area includes four distinct basins (Figure 1), of which Drin and Drina are river basins and Prespa and Skadar are lake basins.",PMC7402417_figure_1,Fig. 1.,Four basins in the western Balkans,./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/0a96f79754d2/nihms-1597955-f0001.jpg

PMC7402417,"Functional components
The functional components (Figure 3A) reflect the integrity of the individual environmental systems of a watershed.",PMC7402417_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Maps of the six catchment functional component values from Eqn. 1 (a), the Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) map (b), the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) map (c), High and Low ICI and IWI map (d)",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/74090a365db5/nihms-1597955-f0003.jpg
PMC7402417,"The regions with the lowest ICI values (Fig. 3B) were near the confluence of the Drina and the Sava and in NW Albania, while those with the highest ICI values were within the Dinaric Alps (central Montenegro, SE Bosnia, N and E Albania).",PMC7402417_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Maps of the six catchment functional component values from Eqn. 1 (a), the Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) map (b), the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) map (c), High and Low ICI and IWI map (d)",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/74090a365db5/nihms-1597955-f0003.jpg
PMC7402417,"In terms of biogeographic zones (Figure 1), the mean Alpine ICI was 0.53 (SD = 0.15), the mean ICI of the Mediterranean Zone was 0.46 (SD = 0.18), and the mean ICI of the Continental Zone was 0.34 (SD = 0.13).",PMC7402417_figure_1,Fig. 1.,Four basins in the western Balkans,./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/0a96f79754d2/nihms-1597955-f0001.jpg
PMC7402417,"Similar to the ICI results, IWI spatial trends (Figure 3C) were largely influenced by biogeographic zone (Figure 1).",PMC7402417_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Maps of the six catchment functional component values from Eqn. 1 (a), the Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) map (b), the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) map (c), High and Low ICI and IWI map (d)",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/74090a365db5/nihms-1597955-f0003.jpg

PMC7402417,This variability between the functional components (Figure 3A) can be useful to national managers (see 4.2 Management Applications).,PMC7402417_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Maps of the six catchment functional component values from Eqn. 1 (a), the Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) map (b), the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) map (c), High and Low ICI and IWI map (d)",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/74090a365db5/nihms-1597955-f0003.jpg
PMC7402417,"Given that cultural services such as recreation or stewardship are regularly managed at the local scale (Plieninger et al. 2013), whereas regulating services, such as river flood mitigation, are often managed at the national or international scale (Stürck et al. 2014), the levels of information provided by the ICI and the IWI of streams, watersheds, and basins inform the respective local, national, and international management entities (Figure 4).",PMC7402417_figure_4,Fig. 4.,"The Levels of Information (left), when based on a corresponding Aquatic Feature (middle), can inform three respective Management Entities (right); the darker shades of gray demonstrate the availability of Multiple Levels of Information",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_4.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/403eae23f411/nihms-1597955-f0004.jpg
PMC7402417,The three levels of information additionally accommodate scientific recommendations to manage aquatic features at multiple ecological scales (Figure 4) (Allan et al. 1997; De Groot et al. 2010).,PMC7402417_figure_4,Fig. 4.,"The Levels of Information (left), when based on a corresponding Aquatic Feature (middle), can inform three respective Management Entities (right); the darker shades of gray demonstrate the availability of Multiple Levels of Information",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_4.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/403eae23f411/nihms-1597955-f0004.jpg
PMC7402417,"By identifying the functional component with the lowest value in an individual catchment or watershed, the national management authority can identify the individual source(s) of stress (Figure 3A).",PMC7402417_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Maps of the six catchment functional component values from Eqn. 1 (a), the Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) map (b), the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) map (c), High and Low ICI and IWI map (d)",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/74090a365db5/nihms-1597955-f0003.jpg
PMC7402417,Hill et al. (Hill et al. 2017) suggest that the success of biological resource management would increase if management targeted areas with low catchment integrity and high watershed integrity (Figure 3D).,PMC7402417_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Maps of the six catchment functional component values from Eqn. 1 (a), the Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) map (b), the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) map (c), High and Low ICI and IWI map (d)",./data/PMC7402417/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ba22/7402417/74090a365db5/nihms-1597955-f0003.jpg
