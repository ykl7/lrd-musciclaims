Multi-view camera set-up producing a 3D structured facial mesh, with skin texture, using 30,000–50,000 vertices (viewed from top of skull). (C) A 3D sense of re-created depth. Despite being on a two-dimensional computer screen, a 3D face reconstructed with multi-view camera set-up, produced an illusion of depth. The final reconstruction produces the same facial model, which stands out from the background and appear more lifelike than the 2D photograph. When working with 3D facial stimuli, we can change our viewpoint of the facial stimulus. Here we have manipulated the viewer angle of the camera along a Z-axis is possible (top-frontal view), to view the same frame of a face from many possible 360 degree viewpoints.",

BP4D-Spontaneous Database, as of: 26/03/2018. 3D faces are built on-screen as models with a geometric mesh in a three-dimensional plane; presenting an anatomically accurate modeled object with width, height and depth. This is captured by the 3D camera set-up. This reconstruction by computer-scientists is highly individualized, but is typically underlined by a geometric mesh or structure. The 3D surface features of the individual are then rendered. As the face moves around in 3D space, it becomes apparent why having three dimensions maintains facial structure more realistically than a facial model built with only two dimensions, as indicated by the depth plane.",
