Trends in cattle and shoat populations in the Mara ecosystem from 1977 to 2014Livestock trend analysis in relation to conservancies
So what do livestock count data show us about how conservancies are affecting the density and composition of livestock, inside and outside of conservancies? Cattle densities are highly variable and show little discernible change in density over time but with severe drops in density evident during well-known drought periods in 1999 to 2000 and 2009 (Figure 8 on cattle).",PMC6991982_figure_8,Figure 8.,"Trends in cattle and shoat density, inside and outside of conservancies, 1977 to 2014, Koyiaki Group Ranch.
