A total of 1222 records were identified (1210 via databases up until 19 July 2021 and 12 via other methods, Figure 1).",PMC9111057_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,"PRISMA 2020 flow diagram of included studies. Record—The title or abstract (or both) of a report indexed in a database or website (such as a title or abstract for an article indexed in Medline). Records that refer to the same report (such as the same journal article) are ‘duplicates’; however, records that refer to reports that are merely similar (such as a similar abstract submitted to two different conferences) are considered unique. Report—A document (paper or electronic) supplying information about a particular study. It could be a journal article, preprint, conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report, dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report, or any other document providing relevant information. Study—An investigation, such as a clinical trial, that includes a defined group of participants and one or more interventions and outcomes. A ‘study’ might have multiple reports. For example, reports could include the protocol, statistical analysis plan, baseline characteristics, results for the primary outcome, results for harms, results for secondary outcomes and results for additional mediator and moderator analyses",./data/PMC9111057/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6969/9111057/e571c8fc3617/RMV-32-0-g001.jpg
