  "figure_1": "PRISMA 2020 flow diagram template for systematic reviews (adapted from flow diagrams proposed by Boers131 and Mayo-Wilson et al.65 and Stovold et al.132). The boxes in grey should only be completed if applicable; otherwise they should be removed from the flow diagram. Note that a “report” could be a journal article, preprint, conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report, dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report or any other document providing relevant information."
