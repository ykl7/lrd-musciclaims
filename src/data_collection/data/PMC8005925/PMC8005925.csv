Essential elements


Report, ideally using a flow diagram, the number of: records identified; records excluded before screening (for example, because they were duplicates or deemed ineligible by machine classifiers); records screened; records excluded after screening titles or titles and abstracts; reports retrieved for detailed evaluation; potentially eligible reports that were not retrievable; retrieved reports that did not meet inclusion criteria and the primary reasons for exclusion (such as ineligible study design, ineligible population); and the number of studies and reports included in the review.",PMC8005925_figure_1,Fig 1.,"PRISMA 2020 flow diagram template for systematic reviews (adapted from flow diagrams proposed by Boers131 and Mayo-Wilson et al.65 and Stovold et al.132).
