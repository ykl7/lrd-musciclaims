  "figure_6": "A maximum likelihood phylogenomic tree of M. ulcerans isolates was estimated using core genome SNPs, with branch lengths corresponding to SNP distances. The tree illustrates the clustering of isolates, with isolates from Batemans Bay and Far East Gippsland forming a distinct cluster. The lineage harboring the Batemans Bay and Far East Gippsland isolates traces back to the south-eastern Australian M. ulcerans most recent common ancestor, before branching out towards isolates from the more western localities of Gippsland, Phillip Island, and the Port Phillip Bay area.
