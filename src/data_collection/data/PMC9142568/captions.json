  "figure_1": "Extending FAIR to data graphics. In the paradigm of charts as metadata, a chart object is modeled as a set of metadata that includes semantic context (SPARQL query) and visual context (Vega-Lite chart specification). With the SPARQL query language and the Vega-Lite grammar of interactive graphics, one can specify interactive charts (bar charts, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.) that remain synchronized to the content of the knowledge graph and whose data marks can link to dereferenceable URIs (DOIs, images, other charts, etc.) through hyperlink encoding channels. Combined, these tools offer a human- and machine-interpretable way to explore and share scientific data.",
  "figure_2": "Interactive views of sample data, meta-analyses, and stylized infographics. Charts shown here are specified by a SPARQL query (semantic context) as well as Vega-Lite specification (visual context). The snapshots of interactive data graphics shown here display (a) mechanical tensile testing data curated from Bandyopadhyay et al. (2005)48, transformed into a layered composite view; (b) a Weibull plot of dielectric testing data using custom y-axis scaling and the regression transform to estimate dielectric breakdown strength (DBS); (c) a meta-analysis of nanocomposite filler materials in curated research articles per year of publication, highlighted to show the trend for graphene; (d) a meta-analysis of entity-resolved compound names (computed by the ChemProps API34) versus curator-provided strings; (e) an infographic showing a dataset with increasingly interactive views; and (f) an explanatory graphic for viscoelastic data. These examples created for the materials science domain represent a small subset of the variety of datasets and visualizations made possible by using SPARQL queries and Vega-Lite specifications to capture interactive views of content from a knowledge graph database.",
  "figure_3": "Direct linking to representations of resources in the knowledge graph. These charts make use of dereferenceable URIs in the knowledge graph to display or link to resources. (a) Image marks with accompanying URL encoding channels are used to display curated sample images from Natarajan et al. (2013)49 corresponding to the selected points on the adjacent scatter plot. (b) Text marks with a hyperlink encoding channel link open the URL of a journal article DOI when selected. (c) A scatter plot displays charts published to the knowledge graph, arranged by the character length of their Vega-Lite specification and description. Point marks with the hyperlink encoding channel link to a chart page when selected. This final chart is self-referential; the highlighted point mark represents the chart itself.",
  "figure_4": "Interoperability with other web platforms and FAIR data sources. The ability of public SPARQL endpoints to send queries and receive data through internet protocols enables interoperability within a query (e.g., federated querying from DBpedia36) as well as displaying and processing information from the knowledge graph using external web-based platforms, such as an Observable notebook (https://observablehq.com/@mdeagen/figure-4-notebook).",
  "figure_5": "Metadata describing a chart resource in the knowledge graph. Each chart instance is a member of the class sio:Chart, with metadata including a thumbnail depiction (created at the time of chart publication) as well as string literals defining the title, description, query, and chart specification. URI namespace prefixes are shown at the bottom.",
  "figure_6": "Minimal example of a chart specification. The bar chart in the lower left, showing the counts of curated research articles grouped by year of publication, was generated from a query and chart specification each containing approximately 150 characters. The faceted plot in the lower right, also generated using SPARQL and Vega-Lite, encodes character counts as the size of point marks to compare the relative brevity of this minimal example query and chart specification to other interactive, layered, and stylized charts featured in this article."
