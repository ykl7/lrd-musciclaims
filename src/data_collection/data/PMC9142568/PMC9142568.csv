PMC9142568,"This article illustrates such an approach, on a knowledge graph database, through the combination of a robust visualization grammar (Vega-Lite) and the query language for the semantic web (SPARQL) (Fig. 1).",PMC9142568_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"Extending FAIR to data graphics. In the paradigm of charts as metadata, a chart object is modeled as a set of metadata that includes semantic context (SPARQL query) and visual context (Vega-Lite chart specification). With the SPARQL query language and the Vega-Lite grammar of interactive graphics, one can specify interactive charts (bar charts, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.) that remain synchronized to the content of the knowledge graph and whose data marks can link to dereferenceable URIs (DOIs, images, other charts, etc.) through hyperlink encoding channels. Combined, these tools offer a human- and machine-interpretable way to explore and share scientific data.",./data/PMC9142568/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b21f/9142568/0753980702db/41597_2022_1352_Fig1_HTML.jpg
