  "figure_1": "Particulate DA in water (pDA) levels (ng/dL) over time (green bars) and tissue DA levels (ppm; orange bars), superimposed on Pseudo-nitzschia count (cells/L) from water samples (blue line). Sampling events are indicated by black stars. Although a large spike in Pseudo-nitzschia occurred in August 2022, there was little DA in the Pseudo-nitzschia cells or in razor clam tissue at that time. However, by the second sampling time (8 November 2022), DA was detected in both water and tissue samples. The fishery is closed when razor clam tissue DA levels reach 20 ppm, represented by the dashed black line."
