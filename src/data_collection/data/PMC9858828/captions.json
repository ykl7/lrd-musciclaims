  "figure_1": "In reference parsing, the input is a single reference string, and the output corresponds to metadata such as the author name, title, and journal. Parsed metadata field values are typically stored in machine-readable XML or JSON formats.",
  "figure_2": "After tokenizing a reference string, each token is assigned specific labels. The tokens related to the metadata are assigned the labels for metadata field types. Other tokens not related to the metadata are assigned the “other” label.",
  "figure_3": "The corpus was constructed as detailed in the following steps: (i) we first collected candidate references and their metadata from the KISTI database to automatically label the references; (ii) we then tokenized all the reference strings and pre-labeled the tokens of each reference string with IOB tags using a string matching approach based on the corresponding metadata field values; (iii) we precisely inspected whether the tokens of each reference string were correctly labeled based on the annotation guidelines.",
  "figure_4": "The first column represents the reference strings. The rest of the columns describe the metadata field values, which were manually entered by curators. Depending on the ability of the curators, the quality of the entered values may vary.",
  "figure_5": "For each reference, the first column represents the token sequence. The second column shows the IOB tags that were automatically assigned by string matching. The annotators wrote their decisions in the decision box on the last line.",
  "figure_6": "The first and second columns represent the model name and the input reference, respectively. The third column shows the language type of each reference string. The remainder are the predicted metadata field values with the decision boxes. The annotators manually entered their decisions into the decision boxes.",
  "figure_7": "The first column represents the tokens corresponding to the reference string and the second column represents the IOB tags corresponding to the tokens. Tokens and IOB labels were separated by tabs.",
  "figure_8": "The first graph shows the results for all the 12,887 references; the rest represent the results for the 9,539 English and 3,348 non-English references.",
  "figure_9": "The X-axis represents each non-English reference. The red circles indicate the similarity values for the non-English references for BERT-REF1, and the black circles represent the corresponding similarity values for GROBID."
