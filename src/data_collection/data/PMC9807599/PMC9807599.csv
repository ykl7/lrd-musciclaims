PMC9807599,"In the EEG neurophysiological analysis, a total of 6 subjects were excluded: from group MC, 1 subject was excluded due to equipment issues and 1 other subject for not completing the study (the same subject as before); and from group CM, 1 subject was excluded due to equipment issues, 1 subject due to experimental error, and 2 subjects due to their EEG data containing too many artifacts to perform the offline analysis.Experimental design
