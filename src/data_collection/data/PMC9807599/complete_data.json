Left-right (LR) and up-down (UD), the dashed lines are for illustrative purposes only and were not visible in the actual experiment. Scalp topographies show regions of mu power increase (yellow) and decrease (blue) during each trial type (i.e., left vs right and up vs down). The colors represent the distribution of mu rhythm power calculated for each electrode during the different trial types. (B) Each trial: 2 s of intertrial interval, 2 s of target presentation, and up to 6 s of cursor control with visual feedback. (C) Session design: Each session consists of part 1, intervention, and part 2. Part 1 contains 3 runs of LR and 3 runs of UD, where one run consists of 25 trials of BCI control. Intervention is either a 20-min meditation or control task, and part 2 contains 3 runs of LR and 3 runs of UD tasks each (practice runs for the LR and UD tasks in session 1 are not included in the figure). (D) Group assignment: Group MM (N = 10) performed brief meditation with audial guidance in both sessions; group MC (N = 12) performed meditation with audial guidance in session 1 and listened to control recording in session 2; group CM (N = 15) listened to control recording in session 1 and performed brief meditation with audial guidance in session 2.",
