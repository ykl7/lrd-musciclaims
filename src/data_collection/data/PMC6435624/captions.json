  "figure_1": "Contrast injection through a haemodialysis catheter in a patient with fibrin sheath formation. A filling defect is seen at the distal tip of the catheter compatible with a small associated thrombus (thick arrow). Contrast is also seen tracking cranially alongside the catheter deep to the fibrin sheath (thin arrow)",
  "figure_2": "Fluoroscopic image demonstrating over the wire 0.018″ platform standard angioplasty balloons inflated in a ‘kissing’ fashion. Note the balloons are aligned with the offset positions of the distal tips of the venous (distal) and arterial (proximal) lumens (arrows)",
  "figure_3": "Post-treatment contrast injection demonstrating significant improvement in flow with only a residual filing defect (arrow) alongside the distal tip of the catheter",
  "figure_4": "Magnified image from Fig. 1 on the left with pre-procedure contrast injection demonstrating contrast layering under an adherent fibrin sheath (solid long arrow) extending beyond the distal tip of the catheter (solid short arrow). Magnified image from Fig. 3 on the right in the same patient following TuLIP showing disrupted fibrin sheath with only a tiny remnant (long dashed arrow) and greatly improved contrast flow (short dashed arrow)"
