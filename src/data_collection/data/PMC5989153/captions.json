Left: trends in funding source distribution for all drug trials conducted after 1 Jan 1997 until 19 July 2017 (based on the start_date data field). Right: overall funding source distribution for all registered drug studies. NIH=National Institutes of Health",

Each radar chart illustrates differences between three groups of trials (represented by coloured polygons) with respect to 15 trial protocol characteristics (individual radial axes). Each axis shows fraction of trials with given property, such as reported use of randomisation, blinding, or data monitoring committees (DMC). Left: trial characteristics by clinical phase. Right: characteristics of phase II treatment oriented trials for three representative diseases. Profile of glioblastoma (with many small non-randomised studies) is typical of oncology trials; see supplementary file 2. NIH=National Institutes of Health",

Detailed statistics across four funding categories and remaining clinical phases are available in supplementary file 4. NIH=National Institutes of Health",

Plots compare characteristics of all phase II trials (regardless of completion status) divided into four temporal subsets based on their starting year.

Radar chart illustrates differences between three groups of trials (represented by coloured polygons) with respect to 15 trial protocol characteristics (individual radial axes). Axis shows fraction of trials with given property, such as reported use of randomisation, blinding, or data monitoring committees (DMC). Trials published as articles are divided into high and low impact classes based on 2016 H-index of corresponding journal (see Methods). Among 945 trials published in high impact journals (H-index >400), 459 (48.6%) were funded by big pharma, 178 by other organisations, 169 by small pharma, and 139 by National Institutes of Health.
