PMC8158921,"In this article we speak from our experience, as a lab group at the University of Massachusetts that meets regularly (Fig 1).",PMC8158921_figure_1,"Fig 1. At the time of this publication, our lab meetings typically consisted of one principal investigator, 5–10 graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, some undergraduates, and a few visiting students.","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meetings had a mix of in-person and virtual attendees to maximize inclusion and accessibility, and attendees frequently brought snacks to share if they desired to do so. At the onset of the pandemic, our lab meetings demonstrated adaptability (see Rules 3 and 10) by shifting into a fully virtual environment (Box 1). In weekly meetings throughout the semester, our typical format has lab members rotate as meeting facilitators each week by leading a journal article discussion, discussing a topic of interest to lab members (e.g., career guidance, science communication, issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice), or getting feedback on a current research effort (e.g., manuscript draft, upcoming presentation, defense rehearsal). Each meeting begins with an icebreaker to foster supportiveness and a brief reflection on our discussion ground rules to collectively recommit to meetings that are open, mindful, and respectful.

PMC8158921,"The key to planning productive lab meetings boils down to discussing and determining as a team the answers to why, who, what, where, when, and how: Why are lab meetings important for the functioning of the lab? Who will participate? What will be the focus of lab meetings? When and where should the lab meetings occur? How should each meeting be structured and carried out so that the goals and objectives of the lab and its participants are met?

PMC8158921,"Rule 1: Define lab mission and objectives
As with any meeting we encounter in academic settings (e.g., committee meetings, faculty meetings, advisor meetings), lab meetings will be most effective and productive if they have clearly articulated objectives and fit within the overall lab mission (Fig 2) [5].",PMC8158921_figure_2,Fig 2. There is no “one size fits all” approach to design or implement productive lab meetings.,"Here are 2 different examples of how to envision lab meetings, the structures of goals, timelines, and collective or individual responsibilities. (A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session).
