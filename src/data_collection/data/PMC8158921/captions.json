  "figure_1": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meetings had a mix of in-person and virtual attendees to maximize inclusion and accessibility, and attendees frequently brought snacks to share if they desired to do so. At the onset of the pandemic, our lab meetings demonstrated adaptability (see Rules 3 and 10) by shifting into a fully virtual environment (Box 1). In weekly meetings throughout the semester, our typical format has lab members rotate as meeting facilitators each week by leading a journal article discussion, discussing a topic of interest to lab members (e.g., career guidance, science communication, issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice), or getting feedback on a current research effort (e.g., manuscript draft, upcoming presentation, defense rehearsal). Each meeting begins with an icebreaker to foster supportiveness and a brief reflection on our discussion ground rules to collectively recommit to meetings that are open, mindful, and respectful.

  "figure_2": "Here are 2 different examples of how to envision lab meetings, the structures of goals, timelines, and collective or individual responsibilities. (A) A hierarchical approach to the design and implementation of productive lab meetings. This version emphasizes a nested design to represent how each component (or each Rule) influences and informs each other. These can be roughly grouped together based on how they fit into categories of process rules (mustard), group responsibility rules (turquoise), and individual responsibility rules (white), respectively. Although meeting dynamics may play out at several temporal and structural scales, one essential aspect of meeting culture weaves through all layers: being flexible and adaptable (See Rule 10). (B) An integrated approach to visualizing productive lab meetings wherein all components balance. This “balanced” approach illustrates how each aspect of lab meetings and the way in which they are conducted (such as through a set of Ten Simple Rules) all work together to get the desired end result. The facilitator moderates the participants as part of the meeting (work plan/lab session). The lab mission carries the most weight (heavier measurement), the group objectives carry less weight but are important, the roles and rules involve frequent, small, finely tuned changes to get to the end goal/s. The target (under the magnifying glass) can change through time indicating flexibility and adaptability."
