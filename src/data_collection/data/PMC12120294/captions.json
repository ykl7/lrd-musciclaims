  "figure_1": "The model we tested on the potential contributors of ASR based on the GLMs. All pathways are displayed. Statistically significant pathways are highlighted in black (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001). All reported estimates are standardized point estimates. Gray lines indicate nonsignificant pathways.\nNote. ASR = Acceptance of Sugar Relationships in Young Women and Men Scale; HKSS = High-K Strategy Scale; Family Resources = Family Resources Scale; Family Unpredictability = Childhood Unpredictability Scale; STMO = short-term mating orientation."
