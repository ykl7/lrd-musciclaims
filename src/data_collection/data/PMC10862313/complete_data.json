It could be a journal article, preprint, conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report, dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report, or any other document providing relevant information. **Record: the title or abstract (or both) of a report indexed in a database or website (such as the title or abstract for an article indexed in MEDLINE). Records that refer to the same report (such as the same journal article) are ‘duplicates’; however, records that refer to reports that are merely similar (such as a similar abstract submitted to two different conferences) should be considered unique.
