PMC11042854,"As shown in Figure 1c, during the music condition 2 of 23 participants (8.70%) achieved perfect synchronization with the prescribed moderate relative intensity walking cadence, whereas 6 of 23 (26.10%) walked within ±3 steps min−1.",PMC11042854_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Moderate relative intensity cadence discrepancy scores between conditions.

PMC11042854,"However, the ability to entrain varied, with only 8.70% of participants achieving perfect synchronization, and 26.10% within 3 steps −1 (Figure 1c), which was triangulated by qualitative findings, and likely responsible for the inconsistent attainment of moderative relative intensity within this condition.",PMC11042854_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Moderate relative intensity cadence discrepancy scores between conditions.
