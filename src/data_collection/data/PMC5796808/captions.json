  "figure_2": "(A) The NHDPlusV2 geospatial framework that is composed of streams (dashed grey lines), local catchments, and full contributing watersheds. We used StreamCat data at both scales for modeling. (B) We used digital elevations models to delineate just the portion of the local catchment that was upstream from each sample point (dark grey above point labeled “z”). In this example, information from catchments 2 and 3 would then be linked to the split catchment to produce site-specific watershed data.",
  "figure_3": "Boxplots of predicted probabilities of good biological condition [Pr(good)] for a single, national model (A-B) and for region-specific models (C-D) versus observed NRSA condition. Horizontal dashed lines represent Pr = 0.5. Regional abbreviations: CPL = Coastal Plains; WMT = Western Mountains. NRSA Condition = the condition assigned by the National Rivers and Streams Assessment and used as the response variable in our models.",

To improve the visibility of individual stream segments, we mapped values to the incremental NHDPlusV21 catchments in which each segment occurred.

  "figure_7": "Map of streams that met the criteria of our illustrative query to identify candidate streams for conservation. The query identified streams with predicted probabilities of good [Pr(good)] biological condition within the upper 95th percentile of Pr(good) values in each National Aquatic Resource Survey region.",
  "figure_8": "Map of streams that met the criteria of our illustrative query to identify candidate streams for restoration. The query first identified streams with predicted probabilities of good [Pr(good)] biological condition < 0.5 and an index of catchment integrity (ICI) < 0.60 (the 1st quartile of ICI values). The query then identified streams with index of watershed integrity (IWI) values > 0.75 (i.e., higher than mean national IWI). First (Strahler) order streams were excluded from this second query because for these streams ICI and IWI are equivalent and restoration of the catchment should result in the restoration of the watershed. The final query identified streams with an upstream or downstream neighbor with Pr(good) > 0.5, thus improving the likelihood of dispersal of desired taxa from neighboring streams."
