  "figure_1": "Study design. Note. Exemplary story vignettes are depicted to illustrate empathy assessment at pre- and post-intervention and the empathy intervention.",
  "figure_2": "Exemplary story vignette in empathy intervention (control condition, empathy condition). Note. Exemplary story vignettes illustrating the empathy and control condition. The illustration depicts the response to a single emotion (sadness) in the empathy condition and a response (pencil case) in the control condition.",
  "figure_3": "Effects of the empathy intervention on children’s empathy from pre- to post-intervention. Note. Children’s empathy scores across conditions and study phases. Black dots represent data points for each study phase; black lines link individuals across study phases. Blue (right panel) and yellow lines (left panel) link means across study phases; violin plots indicate kernel probability densities of the data. Box plots indicate medians (black horizontal lines) and interquartile ranges (boxes) for each study phase and condition; data is jittered on the x-axis for better visualization.",
  "figure_4": "Relation between children’s empathy and their prosocial behaviors. Note. Fitted values of model estimates for the effects of condition and age (Hypotheses 2 and 4, upper panel) and the effects of children’s baseline empathy at pre-intervention (Hypotheses 3 and 5). Grey areas depict 95%-CIs; data are jittered on the y-axis for better visualization."
