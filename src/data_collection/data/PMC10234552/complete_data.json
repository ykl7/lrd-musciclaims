Each map includes measurements represented as circles. The gray lines represent the major roads. The gradient bar in figures a, b, and d represents concentration levels in μg/m3. Also shown is one of the RAMP curves (c) used to correct biases from the Hybrid model. The grey dots represent paired observed and modeled daily PM2.5 concentrations for all of 2016 consisting of the 50 closest AQS measurement stations to the centroid of the CMAQ grid cell G(p). The dashed vertical lines represent the 10 equally divided bins used to stratify all the paired data where each bin includes one decile of all the paired points. The solid black line is the one-to-one line between model and observed. The red dots in each bin identify  the average of paired observed values within each decile bin. The red dots are linearly interpolated to obtain λ1(p) corresponding to the hybrid modeled data  with G(p).",
