(A) A ligand-free lanthanide-doped dielectric NP (permittivity εNP) in a medium (permittivity εm). (B) A dielectric NP:Ln coated with ligands (coating permittivity εc). The electric double layer is indicated by the circles. (C) Optical trapping strength, represented by the Q-factor, as a function of the zeta potential for different types of NP:Ln.
