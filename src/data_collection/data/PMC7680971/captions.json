  "figure_1": "Optical trapping of a NP:Ln in a solvent by different systems based on the reduction of the optical trap volume. (A) A ligand-free lanthanide-doped dielectric NP (permittivity εNP) in a medium (permittivity εm). (B) A dielectric NP:Ln coated with ligands (coating permittivity εc). The electric double layer is indicated by the circles. (C) Optical trapping strength, represented by the Q-factor, as a function of the zeta potential for different types of NP:Ln.

(G) Tip of an optical fiber with an array of coupled spherical microlenses that are able to trap nanoparticles. The fiber probe also records the detection signal. The sequential growth, in backscattering signal, as different nanoparticles are trapped by the microlenses is shown in (H). Adapted with permission from Li Y. et al. (2016).
