PMC7680971,They experimentally demonstrated that the optical forces (parameterized by the trapping factor Q) acting on a NP:Ln depend on the electrostatic properties (zeta potential) of the interface between the NP and the surrounding medium more strongly than on their volume (see expression 2 and Figure 1C).,PMC7680971_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Optical trapping of a NP:Ln in a solvent by different systems based on the reduction of the optical trap volume.

PMC7680971,"As shown in Figure 1D, they employed this strategy to measure the length of single bacterium by co-trapping in a row a KLu2F7:Yb,Er NP:Ln of 120 nm (with a trap stiffness of 14.1 pN/m W), a single E. coli bacterium, and then a second NP:Ln (12.8 pN/mW).",PMC7680971_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Optical trapping of a NP:Ln in a solvent by different systems based on the reduction of the optical trap volume.
