  "figure_1": "(a) A robotic arm is used to position the flat‐panel insert at an arbitrary location inside or near the scanner's field‐of‐view; (b) The flat panel detector with its carbon fiber cover removed. A cell phone is shown for size reference. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",

  "figure_3": "(a) Setup of the torso phantom imaging experiment with the virtual‐pinhole positron emission tomography device underneath the bed; (b) Photo showing the fillable lesions of different sizes. For each size group, only three lesions were filled with blue dyes and radioactivity. The others were filled with water. All the tumors were centered on the same slice with −10 mm offset from the center slice of the scanner in the Z direction. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
  "figure_4": "Drawings illustrating the first (a) and the second (b) configuration of the virtual‐pinhole positron emission tomography device in a GATE simulation study to measure lesion detectability; (c) Location of 63 spherical tumors in an elliptical torso phantom. All tumors are 4 mm in diameter with a T/B = 6. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
  "figure_5": "Count rate profiles at different positions across the axial field‐of‐view. Here, SS represents the coincidence events among scanner detectors, and IS represents the coincidence events between Insert detectors and Scanner detectors when the virtual‐pinhole positron emission tomography (VP‐PET) device is attached to the scanner. “Scanner only” represents measurements conducted without the VP‐PET device.

  "figure_6": "(a) Setup of the imaging study: the virtual‐pinhole positron emission tomography insert was either unattached or positioned around the torso phantom. The figure without insert attached was a computed tomography (CT) image, while the figures with insert attached are not CT images but drawings that show the relative locations of the insert to the phantom; (b) The corresponding reconstructed images using an acquisition time equivalent to 200 s during a typical clinical fluorodeoxyglucose scan.
