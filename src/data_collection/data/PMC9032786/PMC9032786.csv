PMC9032786,The aggressive and lytic nature of the tumor can lead to varying degrees of vertebral compression ranging from mild to outright vertebral plana (Figure 1).,PMC9032786_figure_1,Figure 1.,(a) Lateral radiograph of a biopsy confirmed L5 Giant Cell Tumor; arrows indicate characteristic soap bubble appearance in the L5 vertebral body with loss of vertebral body height indicating pathologic vertebral body fracture. (b) Lateral radiograph of the same L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab treatment showing consolidation of the tumor.,./data/PMC9032786/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0861/9032786/f63c7a48c709/diagnostics-12-00857-g001.jpg
PMC9032786,"The cortex displays thinning or complete eradication, in which case there is an extension of the tumor into the surrounding soft tissue (Figure 2).",PMC9032786_figure_2,Figure 2.,(a) Axial CT cuts of L5 vertebral body shows pseudotrabeculation of vertebral body with eccentric thinning of the right vertebral body cortex and formation of a contralateral sclerotic margin. (b) Bilateral pedicle involvement with near complete destruction of right sided L5 pedicle. (c) Sagittal cuts of L5 vertebral body shows loss of vertebral height indicating compression fracture with no retropulsion of bony elements. The lesion is seen to by lytic with cortical erosion especially in the posterior vertebral body. (d) Sagittal cut of L5 vertebral body demonstrates classic “soap bubble” imaging characteristic seen on the vertebral body of L5 on CT scan.,./data/PMC9032786/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0861/9032786/46a0db256baf/diagnostics-12-00857-g002a.jpg
PMC9032786,"Aoki et al. showed, in a review of 10 MRI of GCT of the spine, that haemosiderin deposition shows nodular, zonal, whorled, or diffuse low signal intensity on all sequence images with low intensity further exaggerated on T2 images (Figure 3).",PMC9032786_figure_3,Figure 3.,(a) Axial T2 weighted MRI cuts of L5 vertebral body show low signal intensity of the tumor body with extension into bilateral pedicles. There is mild compression of the spinal canal. (b) Sagittal T2 weighted MRI cuts of L5 vertebral body again show low signal intensity. There is retropulsion of the compressed L5 vertebral body causing narrowing of the canal.,./data/PMC9032786/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0861/9032786/348c7d3a4944/diagnostics-12-00857-g003.jpg

PMC9032786,"After treatment with denosumab and resection, a micrograph of tissues harvested showed a fibrous matrix with no multinucleated giant cells (Figure 5).",PMC9032786_figure_5,Figure 5.,(a) Low magnification histologic examination of GCT of L5 vertebral body after 6 months of IV denosumab therapy shows increased ossification.

PMC9032786,"After 26 months, there was no progression of disease and a radiographic evaluation showed a decrease in tumor size and formation of new cortical bone [39] (Figure 6 and Figure 7.",PMC9032786_figure_6,Figure 6.,"(a) L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab treatment. Axial cuts of L5 vertebral body show significant ossification of tumor with reestablishment of previously eroded cortices. (b) Sagittal cuts of L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab therapy show increased loss in vertebral height from previous CT scan; however, cortical margins are reestablished. There appears to be mild retropulsion of L5 vertebral body.",./data/PMC9032786/images/figure_6.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0861/9032786/a4b45b6506a3/diagnostics-12-00857-g006.jpg

T2 weighted axial MRI cuts of L5 vertebral body show normalized bone marrow signal intensity when compared to pre-denosumab imaging.
