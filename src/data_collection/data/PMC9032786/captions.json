  "figure_1": "(a) Lateral radiograph of a biopsy confirmed L5 Giant Cell Tumor; arrows indicate characteristic soap bubble appearance in the L5 vertebral body with loss of vertebral body height indicating pathologic vertebral body fracture. (b) Lateral radiograph of the same L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab treatment showing consolidation of the tumor.",
  "figure_2": "(a) Axial CT cuts of L5 vertebral body shows pseudotrabeculation of vertebral body with eccentric thinning of the right vertebral body cortex and formation of a contralateral sclerotic margin. (b) Bilateral pedicle involvement with near complete destruction of right sided L5 pedicle. (c) Sagittal cuts of L5 vertebral body shows loss of vertebral height indicating compression fracture with no retropulsion of bony elements. The lesion is seen to by lytic with cortical erosion especially in the posterior vertebral body. (d) Sagittal cut of L5 vertebral body demonstrates classic “soap bubble” imaging characteristic seen on the vertebral body of L5 on CT scan.",
  "figure_3": "(a) Axial T2 weighted MRI cuts of L5 vertebral body show low signal intensity of the tumor body with extension into bilateral pedicles. There is mild compression of the spinal canal. (b) Sagittal T2 weighted MRI cuts of L5 vertebral body again show low signal intensity. There is retropulsion of the compressed L5 vertebral body causing narrowing of the canal.",
  "figure_4": "(a) Low magnification histologic examination of GCT of L5 vertebral body shows residual bone trabeculae with focal osteoid production. (b) High magnification histologic examination of a GCT of L5 vertebral body shows mononuclear cells interspersed with multinucleated giant cells.",
  "figure_5": "(a) Low magnification histologic examination of GCT of L5 vertebral body after 6 months of IV denosumab therapy shows increased ossification. (b) Mid-level magnification histologic examination of a GCT of L5 vertebral body shows decreased number of multinucleated giant cells with increased ossification and fibrosis.",
  "figure_6": "(a) L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab treatment. Axial cuts of L5 vertebral body show significant ossification of tumor with reestablishment of previously eroded cortices. (b) Sagittal cuts of L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab therapy show increased loss in vertebral height from previous CT scan; however, cortical margins are reestablished. There appears to be mild retropulsion of L5 vertebral body.",
  "figure_7": "(a) L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab treatment. T2 weighted axial MRI cuts of L5 vertebral body show normalized bone marrow signal intensity when compared to pre-denosumab imaging. (b) Sagittal T2 weighted cuts of L5 Giant Cell Tumor after 6 months of IV denosumab therapy show reduction of retropulsion into the canal likely secondary to consolidation of tumor.",
