  "figure_2": "Comparison of the modified MT3D-USGS model outcomes with experimental data of Wang et al.49 at two chemical conditions: (a) 50 mM KCl (b) 0.5 mM CaCl2. The full experimental details are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The modelling approaches include the use of CFT-DLVO and ANN based correlations for predicting attachment (Katt) and detachment (Kdet) rate coefficients.",
  "figure_5": "Model-produced DH at different observation wells of the 3–D model domain for various scenarios of aggregation included (αagg ≠ 0) or not included (αagg = 0) and acceleration not included (No Kd), assumed constant (Const. Kd), or assumed variable (Var. Kd).",
  "figure_6": "Cumulative residual concentration profiles calculated by particle-volume weighted mean of concentrations across PSDs along the row of observation wells at the centreline of injection-extraction well mainstream (a) and its evolution over time at observation wells #2, #7, and #8 without (αagg = 0) and with (αagg = 1) incorporating aggregation. Deposition is considered using a size-variable Katt calculated using CFT-DLVO. No acceleration factor has been included."
