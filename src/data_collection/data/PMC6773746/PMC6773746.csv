PMC6773746,"Investigating mean hydrodynamic diameter growth over time as shown in Fig. 5, reveals that when aggregation is included, the change in size is not considerable at wells #1 and #2 while it becomes significant at wells #3 to #6, where size trends exhibit a peak corresponding to the centre of the BTC but, with a more gradual rise and fall compared to the BTC.",PMC6773746_figure_5,Figure 5.,"Model-produced DH at different observation wells of the 3–D model domain for various scenarios of aggregation included (αagg ≠ 0) or not included (αagg = 0) and acceleration not included (No Kd), assumed constant (Const.
