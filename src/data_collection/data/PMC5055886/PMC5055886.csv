PMC5055886,"On the other hand, the loss of the RFI from solvent relaxation quenching may be attributed to the less hydrophobic contacts, hence, a lower energy level of excited Trp (Rizzo et al. 1986).SDS–PAGE

PMC5055886,"The electrophoretic patterns of SP–PD conjugates with peptide-staining Coomassie blue reagent (Fig. 4a) showed a faint, continuing smear that ran through the entire upper region (>30 kDa) of the lane in the SP–PD1 and SP–PD2 samples, differing sharply from the SP control (without dextran) that consisted of only the fragments of soy proteins (<30 kDa).",PMC5055886_figure_4,Fig. 4.,"SDS–PAGE of SP–PD conjugates (60 °C, 48 h) and SP/PD mixtures (4 °C, 48 h). a Coomassie blue staining, b glycoprotein staining",./data/PMC5055886/images/figure_4.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5cf4/5055886/6e2230130fa3/13197_2016_2296_Fig4_HTML.jpg
