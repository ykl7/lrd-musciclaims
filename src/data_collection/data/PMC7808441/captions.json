  "figure_1": "Conceptual model of the BCG, showing stages of change in biological conditions from Level 1 to 6 in response to increasing landscape stressors or decreasing integrity. The landscape integrity gradients can be represented by the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) that incorporate anthropogenic stressors known to degrade six key watershed functions. The figure is modified from USEPA (2016b) where BCG is shown in reverse slope from degraded to improved biological conditions.",
  "figure_2": "A 2D scatterplot showing the hypothetical relationship between a generic site-scale biological condition indicator and generic watershed- and catchment-scale integrity indicators. The points represent site condition estimates from poor condition (red) to good condition (pale blue). Various indicators could be used to represent biological condition (e.g., the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG), a NRSA indicator, an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI or an MMI) and landscape integrity gradients (e.g., the nationally available Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI), or state or regional watershed- and catchment-scale indicators). Watershed- and catchment-scale indicators can either be plotted on a scale of integrity (as shown here), or on a scale of stressors which would be plotted as 1 minus the index value (e.g., 1 – IWI value) so that high stressors are at the origin, and low stressors are associated with the upper right quadrant.",
  "figure_3": "A landscape integrity map for the Western Balkans showing high and low watershed- and catchment-scale integrity based on values derived from the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) (from Aho et al., 2020).",
  "figure_4": "A 3D scatterplot showing the hypothetical relationship between a generic site-scale biological response indicator and three stressor gradients: watershed-scale, catchment-scale, and stream-reach scale. The color of the plotted data represents different classes of stream biological condition. Biological condition and the three scales of stressors can be represented by multiple national, regional or state indicators, as shown in the scatterplot.",
