The sizes of the monomer and dimer for SUMO-rNS1 are ~ 62 kDa and 120 kDa due ~ 15 kDa SUMO tag whereas the sizes for monomer and dimer of unfused commercial rNS1 (NativeAntigen) are 48 kDa and 80 kDa",
  "figure_4": "Serotype-specificity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs 3H7A9, 8A6F2, 6D4B10 and 10H10B5) against DENV-4 determined by iELISA. The bars show mean optical density (OD) at 450 nm which measures MAb reactivity to NS1s to all four DENV-4 serotypes, yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV) and SUMO protein. MAbs 3H7A9, 8A6F2, and 6D4B10 represent anti-NS1 MAbs specific to DENV-4. MAb 10H10B5, which is reactive to SUMO*, represents one of the three non-specific MAbs generated from immunization of SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 fusion protein. The OD value for DENV-4-serotype specific MAbs against rNS1 of other flaviviruses and recombinant SUMO protein was < 0. By contrary, MAbs reactive only to SUMO* protein (10H10B5) did not show any reactivity to rNS1 to YFV and WNV",

The optical density (OD) values at 450 nm were obtained at various concentration of DENV-4 rNS1 with an optimal concentrations for coating antibody, 5-10 μg/ml; capture antibody, 1:2000 dilution and streptavidin-tagged horseradish peroxidase (HRP-SP), 1:2000. WNV was used as the control"
