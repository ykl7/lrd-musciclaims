  "figure_1": "Note. Mean standardized CVLT-II/CVLT-C scores are presented for each treatment group. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Significant group differences are denoted by *. Intrusions are reverse scored, with a higher score representing poorer performance (i.e., more intrusion errors). T1 = Trial 1; T5 = Trial 5; SDFR = Short Delay Free Recall; SDCR = Short Delay Cued Recall; LDFR = Long Delay Free Recall; LDCR = Long Delay Cued Recall; d’ = Recognition Discriminability; Int = Intrusion Errors.",
  "figure_3": "Note. Violin plots describe distribution of encoding scores (top) and retrieval scores (bottom) for individuals classified into each memory profile. Mean (black line) and median (red line) scores are shown for each profile group. Arrows point from most impaired scores (black) to least impaired scores (white). Individuals classified as having an encoding deficit profile had the lowest encoding scores (i.e., poorer performance), while the intact profile group had the highest encoding scores (Panel A). Those classified as having a retrieval deficit profile demonstrated the highest retrieval scores (i.e., greatest benefit from recognition cueing; Panel B)."
