One can notice the difference in lumen sizes between flax and wood. The presence of kink bands in flax is also visible. Images by the author A.B.",

  "figure_8": "The complex dual-scale flow of resin in fibrous preforms can generate voids. Macro-scale flow relates to the advance of resin between yarns or tows (i.e., inter-yarn flow), while micro-scale flow relates to the penetration of resin into a yarn (i.e., intra-yarn flow). Note that permeability is also different at the two scales. For instance, (a) for low fibre content, due to low yarn permeability but high overall permeability, the yarn is not properly impregnated, and thus intra-yarn voids may form, while (b) for high fibre content, although the yarn and overall permeability are similar, capillary flow in the yarn dominates, and therefore inter-yarn voids are formed.
