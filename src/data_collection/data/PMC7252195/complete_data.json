Extra security options like specifying a password (red arrow) to enter the read-out, as well as only allowing authenticated users to participate (purple arrow) can be chosen. A waiting room can also be utilized, where users logging in remotely wait to be admitted into the actual video-conference, in order to avoid “zoom-bombing” from uninvited guests. Other default options, such as turning off participant video and muting microphones can also be specified. (Color version of figure is available online.)",
