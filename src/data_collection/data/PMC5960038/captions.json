  "figure_1": "Phenotype Instance Verification and Evaluation Tool (PIVET) analysis process. Phenotypes are collected in standardized format in a MongoDB (ie, “phenotype database”). For a single phenotype, synonyms for each phenotypic item in a phenotype are generated using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database and ranked based on their similarity to the phenotypic item (ie, “phenotypic item representation”). Co-occurrence analysis is performed on PubMed using the synonyms generated in the previous step (ie, “corpus analysis”). Lift analysis is performed, clinical relevance scores are calculated, and a classifier classifies the phenotype as clinically relevant or not (ie, “clinical validity determination”). The results of the analysis of the phenotype are presented to the viewer (ie, “phenotype evidence results”).",
  "figure_2": "Database for storing phenotype information. The large cylinder at the top represents the phenotype database. The phenotype database consists of phenotypes (documents) extracted from three different sources (bottom). The first set of phenotypes, 80 in total, were generated by machine learning algorithms called Marble and Rubik and annotated for clinical relevance by 3 medical doctors. The second set of phenotypes, 13 in total, we refer to as gold standard phenotypes and come from Phenotype KnowledgeBase, an online repository of domain expert–developed phenotypes. The third set of phenotypes, 9 in total, we refer to as silver standard phenotypes and were derived by domain experts and extracted from a peer-reviewed journal article.",
  "figure_3": "Synonym generation process for the term “hypertension.” First the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database is queried with the term “hypertension,” which returns a list of candidate MeSH terms. From this query result, the “most relevant synonym” is determined through a process of string matching between the original queried term and the candidate synonyms. In this case, the most relevant synonym is “hypertension.” The candidate synonyms are then ranked based on the percentage overlap between PubMed articles that contain the MeSH term associated with the candidate synonym and the MeSH term of the most relevant synonym.",

  "figure_6": "Normalized lift comparison between Phenotype Instance Verification and Evaluation Tool (PIVET) and PheKnow-Cloud. Normalized lift is calculated as follows: the lift for any subset of phenotypic items that occurred in the corpus without regard to whether the subset occurred in a phenotype is calculated. Then the lifts are separated by the cardinality of the subsets, and the standard deviations above the median within that cardinality is computed (ie, this is the normalized lift). The boxplot depicts the normalized lift for the subsets that appeared in each type (ie, “maybe significant,” “not significant,” and “significant”) of phenotype.",
