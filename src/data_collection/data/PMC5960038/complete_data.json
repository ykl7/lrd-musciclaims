For a single phenotype, synonyms for each phenotypic item in a phenotype are generated using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database and ranked based on their similarity to the phenotypic item (ie, “phenotypic item representation”). Co-occurrence analysis is performed on PubMed using the synonyms generated in the previous step (ie, “corpus analysis”). Lift analysis is performed, clinical relevance scores are calculated, and a classifier classifies the phenotype as clinically relevant or not (ie, “clinical validity determination”). The results of the analysis of the phenotype are presented to the viewer (ie, “phenotype evidence results”).",
