This figure contains four scatter plots showing cognitive performance and creativity outcomes measured during acute drug intoxication (plots a and c) or during post-acute phases (plots b and d). The horizontal X-axis shows psilocybin dosage administered in either a bodyweight-adjusted manner represented in µg/kg (plots a and b) or a fixed manner represented in mg (plots c and d). The vertical Y-axis shows the frequency of the reported outcome. The valence of each finding (negative, neutral, or positive) is indicated by the shape’s color, and its corresponding construct (foundational, lower order, higher-order, social cognitive, or creative processes) is indicated by the type of shape. The overall valence of each plot was determined by subtracting negative from positive findings and dividing this by the total number of findings; the result of this equation was used to create a background color. The plot was created in RStudio version 2021.09.0 using the following R packages: tidyverse, xlsx, psych, ggrepel, viridis, ggpubr, cowplot, and grDevices.",
