PMC10510714,"In this method,
the recursive cloning of DNA-barcoded modules via specific designated
restriction sites within the modules (between the construct and the
DNA barcode in each module) results in the accumulation of the DNA
constructs on one side and the DNA barcodes on the other side of the
restriction sites (Figure 1a).",PMC10510714_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Improvements of the CombiGEM process. (a) CombiGEM procedure.
The
CombiGEM method uses the BamHI and EcoRI sites on the vector and the compatible BglII
and MfeI sites in the insert fragments for cloning.
The ligated sites are not recognized by any of the enzymes. The inserts
bring new BamHI and EcoRI sites
within to enable the recursive assembly of modules. The process is
run en masse with a pool of inserts. The resulting
mixture of multimodule constructs are used in experiments. (b) pCombi-CC
vectors. The BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, and MfeI restriction sites were
engineered in the expandable single-copy vector pCC1BAC (Lucigen).
The added BglII and MfeI sites accept
incoming fragments. To introduce functionality such as integration
of the construct into the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn3.0,9 genetic tools are introduced
into these sites along with the first barcode (position 0) to identify
the tools (such as the set for mycoplasma Cre-lox integration). To
make the vector compatible with the ELAN process (pCombi-CC-Myco2-Next-E),
the BglII and MfeI sites were disrupted.
The gene cat encodes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. oriV enables a high-copy replication when trfA gene product is provided in the cell (Lucigen). repE/repA, sopA/parA, sopB/parB, and ori2 (not shown) participate in the replication and partition of F-factor
replicon.",./data/PMC10510714/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f675/10510714/0c3c7ad7f843/sb3c00183_0001.jpg
