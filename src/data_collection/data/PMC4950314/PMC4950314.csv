The web application accepts a document in PDF, HTML, and text formats from a user. A copy of the uploaded document is examined by Genomine algorithm to identify genetic terms. Subsequently, GenoDB supplements the identified terms with multi-dimensional information and delivers to Genotation interface. Genotation interface is the article viewer application where the supplementary information is organized and presented to the user as interactive annotations.

PMC4950314,"As shown in Figure 2, it involves three major steps in producing a set of augmented genetic terms identified from a document.",PMC4950314_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Genomine concept. The objective of the algorithm is to accurately identify terms from the article that could be supplemented with further information. The journal article is initially converted to a plain text copy, where the algorithm compares individual words with a dictionary of all possible terms that have external knowledge. An automated validation is performed at this juncture in order to reduce false positives and negatives. The set of identified terms is the result of the algorithm.

PMC4950314,GenoDB database was designed to store the selected fields of multiple biomedical databases preserving the original meaning and relationships and is implemented using MySQL relational database management system as shown in Figure 3.,PMC4950314_figure_3,Figure 3.,"GenoDB, the synthesized knowledgebase. There are multiple databases that contain valuable biomedical information in verbose detail. Documentation of each database is consulted in identifying the most valuable fields and their structure to be integrated into the knowledgebase. That information is used to create the technical specification for the synthesized database. The database is created on MySQL as detailed in the specification.
