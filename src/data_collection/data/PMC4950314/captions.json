  "figure_1": "Overview of Genotation. The web application accepts a document in PDF, HTML, and text formats from a user. A copy of the uploaded document is examined by Genomine algorithm to identify genetic terms. Subsequently, GenoDB supplements the identified terms with multi-dimensional information and delivers to Genotation interface. Genotation interface is the article viewer application where the supplementary information is organized and presented to the user as interactive annotations. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)",
  "figure_2": "Genomine concept. The objective of the algorithm is to accurately identify terms from the article that could be supplemented with further information. The journal article is initially converted to a plain text copy, where the algorithm compares individual words with a dictionary of all possible terms that have external knowledge. An automated validation is performed at this juncture in order to reduce false positives and negatives. The set of identified terms is the result of the algorithm. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)",
  "figure_3": "GenoDB, the synthesized knowledgebase. There are multiple databases that contain valuable biomedical information in verbose detail. Documentation of each database is consulted in identifying the most valuable fields and their structure to be integrated into the knowledgebase. That information is used to create the technical specification for the synthesized database. The database is created on MySQL as detailed in the specification. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)",
  "figure_4": "The entire screen space is dedicated to displaying the journal article, and the supplements are hidden away in the conspicuous Genotation menu. User can expand the menu to view all the supplements in a collapsed state. Click on a term to expand and drill down to the necessary detail. Click on a link to be re-directed to the source website. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)"
