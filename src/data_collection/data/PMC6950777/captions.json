  "figure_1": "CFA quantifications for the bovine tendon specimen: (a) an experimental photo showing the longitudinal tendon axis of ∼52°, (b) DC intensity versus polarizer angle plots for the selected 3 × 3 grid pixel points, (see red dots in (a)). The angle corresponding to the peak intensity, indicated by the red dashed line, is the quantified fiber orientation angle θfiber. Colormaps of (c) θfiber and (d) DOA at different longitudinal strain levels.",
  "figure_2": "CFA quantifications for porcine mitral valve anterior leaflet specimen #1 (MVAL-1): (a) schematic of the biaxial mechanical testing in conjunction with polarized spatial frequency domain imaging-based collagen CFA quantification, and (b) the quantified collagen fiber orientation (black dashed lines) and the degree of optical anisotropy (colormaps) of the tissue at various loading conditions. Note that warmer colors denote a better aligned collagen fiber network.",

Note that warmer colors denote a better aligned collagen fiber network.",
  "figure_4": "(a) Trimetric view of the integrated opto-mechanical system used in the collection of the presented data, and (b) schematic of a co-polarized pSFDI system, showing the optical components (DLP project, CCD camera, rotational polarizer), the passage of light, and the scattering from the fibrous tissue microstructure."
