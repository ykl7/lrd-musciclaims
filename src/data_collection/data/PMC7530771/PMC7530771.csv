PMC7530771,"The initial rates of •OH reaction with RhB, H2O2, and silica or alumina were contrasted to assess the relative fate of •OH (Fig. 1).",PMC7530771_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"The initial •OH reaction rates with RhB (5 mg/L; 1.04 × 10−2 mmol/L), H2O2 (1000 mg/L; 2.94 mmol/L), and silica (0–30 g/L) or alumina (0–50 g/L).",./data/PMC7530771/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/523e/7530771/782f6af7e5e9/nihms-1570865-f0001.jpg
PMC7530771,"In this analysis, conditions and parameter values were assumed and included an ideal representative volume of unconsolidated porous media (1 m3), 1 pore volume mixture of trichloroethylene (TCE) (10 mg/L) and H2O2 (10 g/L) with instantaneous mixing, no TCE sorption, and [•OH]SS = 5 × 10−16 mol/L (Fig. 2).",PMC7530771_figure_2,Fig. 2.,Calculated •OH reaction and scavenging rates in aquifer material where scavenging rate constants were used from this study.,./data/PMC7530771/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/523e/7530771/d1ba2285ae5e/nihms-1570865-f0002.jpg
PMC7530771,"The rate of •OH reaction with solid surfaces (t = 0 h) dominated the fate of •OH by several orders of magnitude, relative to TCE and H2O2 in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2).",PMC7530771_figure_2,Fig. 2.,Calculated •OH reaction and scavenging rates in aquifer material where scavenging rate constants were used from this study.,./data/PMC7530771/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/523e/7530771/d1ba2285ae5e/nihms-1570865-f0002.jpg
PMC7530771,"Conversely, in our study, •OH reaction was dominated by surface scavenging at 10–50 g/L silica, alumina, or MMT, in both Fe-AHP and UV-AHP systems (Fig. 1), and even greater •OH scavenging was projected under unconsolidated porous media conditions (Fig. 2).",PMC7530771_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"The initial •OH reaction rates with RhB (5 mg/L; 1.04 × 10−2 mmol/L), H2O2 (1000 mg/L; 2.94 mmol/L), and silica (0–30 g/L) or alumina (0–50 g/L).",./data/PMC7530771/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/523e/7530771/782f6af7e5e9/nihms-1570865-f0001.jpg
