PMC6583309,"In JAMA, the most increased terms across our 40-year study period were reflective of the language of epidemiological research (Figure 1 and eFigure in the Supplement).",PMC6583309_figure_1,Figure 1.  Bar Plots of Increased and Decreased Monograms and Bigrams in JAMA.,"The top 20 increased and decreased monograms (single words) and bigrams (pairs of adjacent words) are given as mean (95% CI). For articles of all publication types published from 1976 through 2015, all monograms or bigrams were extracted, and a linear model was performed to estimate mean annual change in frequency during the 40-year period. Common words such as the, to, and and were removed from the monogram analysis, but kept in the bigram analysis owing to their contextual relevance.",./data/PMC6583309/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8240/6583309/72e461f4bd1f/jamanetwopen-2-e191083-g001.jpg
PMC6583309,"Monograms (Figure 1A) such as randomized, trial, outcomes, and risk showed significant increases (mean annual frequency change per 100 000 words, 10.48 to 25.81; FDR < 0.01), consistent with a concurrent decrease in case reports and increase in clinical trial reports across this period.",PMC6583309_figure_1,Figure 1.

PMC6583309,We also noted a shift toward referring to patients in the plural form: bigrams (Figure 1B) such as a patient (−1.66/100 000 words) and patient with (−1.68/100 000 words) decreased (FDR < 0.01) and in patients (6.92/100 000 words) and patients with (11.37/100 000 words) increased (FDR < 0.01).,PMC6583309_figure_1,Figure 1.

PMC6583309,Word clouds were also produced for statistically significant increases or decreases in monograms or bigrams (Figure 2).,PMC6583309_figure_2,Figure 2.  Word Cloud Representation of Significantly Increased or Decreased Monograms and Bigrams in JAMA During the 40-Year Period.,"Monograms indicate single words; bigrams, pairs of adjacent words. Articles of all publication types published in JAMA from 1976 through 2015 were included. The size of each word or pair of words is proportionate to the magnitude of the absolute change in frequency during the course of the 40-year study period.",./data/PMC6583309/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8240/6583309/e69fa9408b77/jamanetwopen-2-e191083-g002.jpg
