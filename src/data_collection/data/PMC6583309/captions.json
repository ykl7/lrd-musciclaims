  "figure_1": "The top 20 increased and decreased monograms (single words) and bigrams (pairs of adjacent words) are given as mean (95% CI). For articles of all publication types published from 1976 through 2015, all monograms or bigrams were extracted, and a linear model was performed to estimate mean annual change in frequency during the 40-year period. Common words such as the, to, and and were removed from the monogram analysis, but kept in the bigram analysis owing to their contextual relevance.",
  "figure_2": "Monograms indicate single words; bigrams, pairs of adjacent words. Articles of all publication types published in JAMA from 1976 through 2015 were included. The size of each word or pair of words is proportionate to the magnitude of the absolute change in frequency during the course of the 40-year study period."
