Levels of collaboration, a scale from less to more collaboration, are defined as follows (Frey et al. 2006): Networking involves awareness of the other organizations, loosely defined roles for working with the group of organizations, and little or infrequent communication with other organizations; all decisions are made independently of other organizations and their goals. Cooperation includes things like providing information to other organizations, having somewhat defined roles for working with the group of organizations, and having formalized communication with other organizations; however, all decisions are made independently of other organizations and their goals. Coordination includes things like sharing information and resources with other organizations; having defined roles for working with the group of organizations; having frequent, formalized communication with other organizations; and sharing some decision making with other organizations. Coalition involves sharing ideas along with frequent and prioritized communication with other organizations; all members have a vote in decision making regarding the common goals and activities of the group. Collaboration means that members belong to one system, frequent communication is characterized by mutual trust, and consensus is reached on all decisions regarding the common goals and activities of the group. Percentages in panels b–e indicate the proportion of all relationships in the network reported to be at that level of collaboration",
