Action plan



What stands out? What do you notice about the whole map?
B

This is not a dense network
Much of the contact between network members is very infrequent (see Fig. 1)


Relationships need to be enhanced but members do not want more frequent meetings
Communication can improve by incorporating discussion of young parents’ needs into existing meetings



What do you notice about your organization and its relationship to other organizations?
B
Most collaboration occurs at less intensive levels (networking, cooperation)

More intensive levels of collaboration are not always needed for effective relationships
The Pathways project is an opportunity for network members to identify the most effective intensity of collaboration needed



Which organizations are ‘key players’?
C

This is a dense network; most organizations know each other (see all maps in Fig. 2)
High degree centralization means a small number of organizations are central to the network
Overall contact is infrequent and collaboration occurs at a lower intensity meaning fewer “key players.”
There are some organizations on the periphery, connected to few or no other organizations


A connection should be established and then strengthened with organizations on the periphery of this network
Future conversations will focus on developing collaboration



Which relationships need to be developed?
C

Peripherally connected organizations are easy to identify in this map, which would not be so apparent with a table of numbers indicating relationship strength
The organization key enabled participants to easily identify which node on the maps represented which organization

Participants discussed ways to connect with one peripheral organization (a phone-based community referral provider), including leveraging existing relationships between this peripheral organization and other network members to strengthen this organization’s connection to the overall network

Levels of collaboration, a scale from less to more collaboration, are defined as follows (Frey et al. 2006): Networking involves awareness of the other organizations, loosely defined roles for working with the group of organizations, and little or infrequent communication with other organizations; all decisions are made independently of other organizations and their goals. Cooperation includes things like providing information to other organizations, having somewhat defined roles for working with the group of organizations, and having formalized communication with other organizations; however, all decisions are made independently of other organizations and their goals. Coordination includes things like sharing information and resources with other organizations; having defined roles for working with the group of organizations; having frequent, formalized communication with other organizations; and sharing some decision making with other organizations. Coalition involves sharing ideas along with frequent and prioritized communication with other organizations; all members have a vote in decision making regarding the common goals and activities of the group. Collaboration means that members belong to one system, frequent communication is characterized by mutual trust, and consensus is reached on all decisions regarding the common goals and activities of the group.
