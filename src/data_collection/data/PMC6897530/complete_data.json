Outcomes shown in blue reflect pretest/posttest measures that are similar to that training materials in methodology and/or stimulus type (near transfer), while outcomes shown in red reflect measures that are different from training content (far transfer). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Numeric values under each outcome represent the number of different comparisons included in the calculation of that outcome’s effect size.",
