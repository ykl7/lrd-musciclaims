PMC6897530,"Overall, similar to other recent meta-analyses (Sala & Gobet, 2017; Soveri, Antfolk, Karlsson, Salo, & Laine, 2017), we found that training produced benefits to working memory tasks similar to the training materials, but not to other outcomes (Figure 1).",PMC6897530_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Effect sizes from Melby-Lervåg et al. (2016) meta-analysis comparing various forms of working memory training versus active control groups. Outcomes shown in blue reflect pretest/posttest measures that are similar to that training materials in methodology and/or stimulus type (near transfer), while outcomes shown in red reflect measures that are different from training content (far transfer). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Numeric values under each outcome represent the number of different comparisons included in the calculation of that outcome’s effect size.",./data/PMC6897530/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/da6b/6897530/90aad65e459b/nihms-1527179-f0001.jpg
