PMC5410598,"It is likely that mechanisms by which carrageenan induces inflammation in the human intestine are similar to animals and multifactorial: the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the disruption of the epithelial barrier, and the interference with innate mucosal immune responses to microorganisms (Figure 1).",PMC5410598_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Proposed biological mechanism: carrageenan and carboxymethylcellulose in processed foods result in the erosion of the protective mucus layer and in the abnormal expression of tight junction proteins. Undigested food particles, toxins, and microorganisms are then able to pass though the intestinal epithelium resulting in translocation of microbes and the overcolonization by pathobionts that can alter the composition of the gut microbiome, triggering the activation of the immune system and the development of inflammation.",./data/PMC5410598/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0e4/5410598/c4d16b68152a/fped-05-00096-g001.jpg
