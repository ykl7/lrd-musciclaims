  "figure_1": "A detailed map of a set of on-network lakes in the state of Oregon. Lake polygons are light blue. National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Plus version 2 catchments are outlined in black. Catchments that intersect with lake waterbodies have black stippling. The watershed of Lake Marion is composed of several, hydrologically linked catchments (pink area). Solid blue lines are NHD rivers and streams, and dashed blue lines are artificial paths used by the NHD to provide connectivity of rivers and streams across lakes. OR = Oregon.",
  "figure_2": "Diagram of the connection between lakes 6 and 7 from Fig. 3. The connection between lakes 6 and 7, and their associated catchments, is identified through a series of spatial shifts of the underlying rasters and a set of queries (see text). The 3 × 3 window that provides detail in this figure is fixed in space and the catchment raster, Cat, is shifted underneath this fixed position to produce Catʹ. However, this 3 × 3 window does not exist when the process is implemented. Instead, shifting and subsequent queries and mathematical operations are conducted on the entire raster data set at once to improve efficiency and to make implementation easier with existing geographic information system tools.",

  "figure_4": "A.—A binary classification of lake samples into eutrophic and noneutrophic conditions based on chlorophyll a concentrations. The USEPA used a criterion of >7 μg/L to designate lakes as eutrophic (USEPA 2017). B.—Predicted probabilities of lake eutrophication [Pr(Eutrophication)] based on a random forest model that used LakeCat metrics as predictor variables. The map represents each lake as a single point. Black points are lakes that were excluded from the National Lakes Assessment sampling frame (see text).",
  "figure_5": "Top 10 variables ranked by their importance to the model (mean decrease in model accuracy). PctAg2011Ws = % of the watershed consisting of agriculture (cropland and hay classes of 2011 National Land Cover Dataset); Pestic97Cat and Pestic97Ws = mean 1997 pesticide use (kg/km2) within catchment and watershed, respectively; FertCat and FertWs = mean rate of synthetic N fertilizer application to agricultural land (kg N ha–1 y–1) within catchment and watershed, respectively; AgKffactWs = mean erodibility factor (unitless) of soils on agricultural land within the watershed; BFICat and BFIWs = mean of US Geological Survey base-flow raster within catchment and watershed, respectively; PctConif2011Ws = % of the watershed composed of coniferous forest (2011 NLCD); CBNFWs = mean rate of biological N2 fixation from the cultivation of crops (kg N ha–1 y–1) within the watershed."
