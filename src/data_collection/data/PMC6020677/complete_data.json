The connection between lakes 6 and 7, and their associated catchments, is identified through a series of spatial shifts of the underlying rasters and a set of queries (see text). The 3 × 3 window that provides detail in this figure is fixed in space and the catchment raster, Cat, is shifted underneath this fixed position to produce Catʹ. However, this 3 × 3 window does not exist when the process is implemented. Instead, shifting and subsequent queries and mathematical operations are conducted on the entire raster data set at once to improve efficiency and to make implementation easier with existing geographic information system tools.",
