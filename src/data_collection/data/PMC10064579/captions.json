The square shape and bar line represent the estimate of effect size and 95% confidence interval for each study, respectively. The diamond shapes represent the pooled estimates of the effect sizes for different behavioral outcomes. Favors B indicates that child maltreatment increases behavior problems, while Favors A indicates child mal-treatment decreases behavior problems.",

The square shape and bar line represent the estimate of effect size and 95% confidence interval for each study, respectively. The diamond shapes represent the pooled estimates of the effect sizes for different behavioral outcomes. Favors B indicates that child maltreatment increases behavior problems, while Favors A indicates child mal-treatment decreases behavior problems.",

  "figure_6": "Funnel plots of the included studies. (A) Studies of physical abuse and externalizing behaviors, (B) studies of physical abuse and internalizing behaviors, (C) studies of emotional abuse and externalizing behaviors, (D) studies of emotional abuse and internalizing behaviors, (E) studies of neglect and externalizing behaviors, (F) studies of neglect and internalizing behaviors, and (G) all studies included in the meta-analysis. Hedges’s g was calculated from Cohen’s d multiplying J, where  to correct for potential bias introduced by studies with small sample sizes (N)."
