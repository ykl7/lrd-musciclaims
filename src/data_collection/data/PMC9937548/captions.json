  "figure_1": "Example trial from the partial repetition cost (PRC) task. The response cue (e.g., “1”) appears before the Cued Response Stimulus (e.g., a green square) which, in turn, appears before the Discrimination Response Stimulus (e.g., a blue square)",
  "figure_2": "Idealized partial repetition costs related to a color by response interaction in the two-choice partial repetition cost (PRC) task. Mean response time (RT) to the second colored square is relatively short when both color and response repeat in complete repetition trials (bottom left) or both change in complete alternation trials (bottom right). In contrast, mean RT to the second colored square is relatively long when (1) the color changes and the response repeats (top left) or (2) the color repeats and the response changes (top right) in partial repetition trials",
  "figure_3": "Partial repetition costs in the two-choice partial repetition cost (PRC) task. Panels a and c (top) show the interaction between color and response. Panels b and d (bottom) show the interaction between location and response. The left panels (a and b) indicate mean response time while the right panels (c and d) indicate mean error rate. Error bars indicate ± 1 SEM as calculated in JASP",
  "figure_4": "Partial repetition costs in the four-choice partial repetition cost (PRC) task. Panels a and c (top) show the interaction between color and response. Panels b and d (bottom) show the interaction between location and response. The left panels (a and b) indicate mean response time while the right panels (c and d) indicate mean error rate. Error bars indicate ± 1 SEM as calculated in JASP",

Panels a and c (top) show the interaction between color and response while panels b and d (bottom) show the interaction between location and response. In addition, panels a and b (left) show the mean z-RT data from the two-choice PRC task while panels c and d (right) show the mean z-RT data from the four-choice PRC task.
