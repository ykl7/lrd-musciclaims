PMC7798706,"We analysed the reporting frequencies and the association between reports in news and press releases.Source materials
The first database contains 1250 news stories, 996 press releases and 996 associated journal articles.8 9 This database was collated by selecting all the press releases related to human health published throughout 2011 from eight leading international biomedical journals (Lancet, British Medical Journal (BMJ), Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Nature Immunology, Nature Medicine and Nature Genetics) and 20 leading UK universities (The Russell Group; see figure 1).",PMC7798706_figure_1,Figure 1.,Flow diagram describing the two datasets and the available numbers for analysis.,./data/PMC7798706/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f164/7798706/c7ea4178b6bc/bmjopen-2020-041385f01.jpg
PMC7798706,"Reporting of conflicts of interest was even rarer: 1% and 0% of news stories (for 2011 and 2015) reported a conflict in the studies where a conflict was declared in the journal article, while 0.1% and 0% of news explicitly reported no conflict for studies that explicitly declared none.Relationship of funding source in press release and the news
If the press release reported a funding source, associated news stories were more likely to report it (figure 2).",PMC7798706_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Proportion of news stories reporting study funding source or industry funding according to whether the associated press release reported the funding source or industry funding. There were zero mentions of industry funding in news in 2015 dataset, so analysis not performed. Error bars are 95% CI. The relative risks for the three plots are: 3.1 (95% CI 2.1 to 4.3); 6.8 (95% CI 2.2 to 17); 2.1 (95% CI 0.94 to 4.5).",./data/PMC7798706/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f164/7798706/e451aff5e998/bmjopen-2020-041385f02.jpg
