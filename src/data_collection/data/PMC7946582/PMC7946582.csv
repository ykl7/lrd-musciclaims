PMC7946582,"SMS reminders will be sent to participants the day before their PA choices in Weeks 2, 5, and 9 as a behavioral prompt.Comparison Program
As Figure 1 describes, participants attending EP or physiotherapy practices allocated to the comparison group will receive a 12-week program that is more self-directed, has fewer consultation sessions, and incorporates fewer behavioral support strategies than the Active Choices program (ie, education, self-monitoring, and action planning only).",PMC7946582_figure_1,Figure 1.,Participant flow through the trial.

Overview
The primary outcome of self-managed moderate intensity PA and secondary outcomes of psychological well-being and social connectedness will be assessed at baseline, end-intervention (Week 12), and follow-up (Week 24; see Figure 1).",PMC7946582_figure_1,Figure 1.,Participant flow through the trial.
