  "figure_1": "PRISMA flow diagram of the identification, screening, and selection of studies on adult organophosphate (OP) and -methyl carbamate (NMC) insecticide exposure and sperm concentration. “Record” refers to a title and abstract. “Report” refers to a full-text journal article, government report, or other document supplying relevant information about a particular study or set of studies. See Table S2 for literature search terms and search dates, Table S3 for NGO search strategies, Table S4 for full-text (all pesticides) screening criteria, and Table S5 for OP and NMC insecticide screening criteria. Regarding “Reports sought for retrieval,” see Excel Table S1 for a complete list of records sought for retrieval and their final inclusion decision and rationale. Note: PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.",
  "figure_3": "Forest plot of study-specific estimates of the bias-adjusted standardized mean difference in sperm concentration between adults more- and less-exposed to organophosphate (OP) and -methyl carbamate (NMC) insecticides (Hedges’ g effect sizes) included in the primary meta-analysis, stratified by exposure setting. Study is defined by the first author’s last name and publication year followed by the numbered citation in brackets. “Parent” refers to the parent insecticide compound, whereas “metabolite” refers to the breakdown product of a parent compound. Weights of each study included in the primary meta-analysis were calculated using the generic inverse variance method. The extracted study results and R code used to calculate study-specific Hedges’ g effect sizes and meta-analysis weights are available on GitHub. Estimated effect sizes were exported from R and imported into Tableau Public to generate this forest plot visualization. An interactive version of this forest plot is available on Tableau Public. Note: 1N, 1-naphthol; DAP, dialkylphosphate; DEDTP, diethyldithiophosphate; DEP, diethylphosphate; DETP, diethylthiophosphate; DMDTP, dimethyldithiophosphate; DMP, dimethylphosphate; DMTP, dimethylthiophosphate; IMPY, 2-isopropoxy-4-methyl-pyrimidinol; PNP, para-nitrophenol; ΣDAP, sum of dialkylphosphates; TCPY, 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol."
