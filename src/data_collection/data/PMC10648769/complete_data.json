Study is defined by the first author’s last name and publication year followed by the numbered citation in brackets. “Parent” refers to the parent insecticide compound, whereas “metabolite” refers to the breakdown product of a parent compound. Weights of each study included in the primary meta-analysis were calculated using the generic inverse variance method. The extracted study results and R code used to calculate study-specific Hedges’ g effect sizes and meta-analysis weights are available on GitHub. Estimated effect sizes were exported from R and imported into Tableau Public to generate this forest plot visualization. An interactive version of this forest plot is available on Tableau Public.
