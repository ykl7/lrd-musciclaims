PMC11784422,"Based on our research question, we have developed a simplified causal diagram as depicted in figure 1A to clearly define potential confounders (ie, age, sex/gender, ethnicity/race-related measures) and mediators (eg, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, physical activity) of the association between SEP and falls.25 Correspondingly, we have placed restrictions on the types of models and specific estimates that we will extract from different study types, to ensure that we extract data from the most appropriate models and to avoid table 2 fallacy by not interpreting statistical estimates of secondary variables from multivariable models (eg, confounders, effect modifiers).26 For studies that specifically aimed to examine the association between SEP and falls, both unadjusted and the most appropriately adjusted models (confounder-adjusted models that do not include mediators) will be extracted.",PMC11784422_figure_1,Figure 1. Simplified causal structures for the association between socioeconomic position and falls. (A) Socioeconomic position and falls simple causal structures; (B) more complex associations between socioeconomic position measured at different life stages across the life course and falls (confounders and mediators are not drawn in (B) for simplicity).,,./data/PMC11784422/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e416/11784422/18f69ffc17ca/bmjopen-15-1-g001.jpg
