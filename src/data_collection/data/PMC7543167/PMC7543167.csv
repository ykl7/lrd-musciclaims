PMC7543167,"Because of this bidirectional transfer of cells, a woman may host cells of fetal origin from her pregnancies and cells of maternal origin from her own mother (Figure 1).2 Furthermore, the same woman might host other cells transferred from her mother during fetal life, including cells possibly stemming from older siblings, a vanishing twin, or prior maternal termination of pregnancy,2,8,9 and even cells of neither fetal nor maternal origin stemming from maternal blood transfusion.9 Not all papers, however, demonstrate increased cFMC of older sibling origin, and further research is needed to uncover all potential sources of microchimerism in women.10

PMC7543167,"Real-time PCR is simpler and more time efficient.11 With either method, the researcher may compare not only the prevalence of cFMC in different groups but also whether the relative quantities of cFMC differ in each subject (Figure 3).",PMC7543167_figure_3,Figure 3.,"Determining prevalence and quantity of fetal microchimerism. Using FISH or quantitative PCR, the prevalence and quantity of cFMC may be determined. The prevalence is obtained by identifying the number of women in each group that have detectable cFMC (individuals shown as shaded) relative to the number of women in each group in which cFMC is not detectable (individuals shown as unshaded) and comparing the two groups.

PMC7543167,"Boddy et al. hypothesize that cFMC may affect lactation, maternal thermoregulation, and mother–child bonding.6 Firstly, they cite a study showing that fetal microchimeric fibroblasts from mice differentiate into mammary epithelial cells when exposed to lactation hormones in vitro46 and another study showing that 56% of healthy parous women carry cFMC in their mammary tissue.47 Secondly, they present evidence that cFMC persists after pregnancy in maternal thyroid tissue48 and speculate that fetal cells may upregulate maternal body temperature in women with newborn infants.6 Finally, based on evidence that fetal cells in maternal mouse brains can differentiate into mature neurons49 and that cFMC may be found in the female human brain,50 they propose an evolutionary role for cFMC in strengthening the emotional tie between mother and child.6The impact of cFMC in inducing immunotolerance during pregnancy and temporary secondary effects on autoimmune disease
In addition to modulating maternal body function postpartum, maternal acquisition of fetal genetic material has been proposed to play a role in inducing materno-fetal tolerance during pregnancy, a factor potentially contributing to why certain autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are temporarily ameliorated during pregnancy.24 In 1993, a study by Nelson et al. looked into fetal–maternal disparity in HLA class II molecules,51 a concept illustrated in Figure 4.",PMC7543167_figure_4,Figure 4.,"Fetal HLA-polymorphisms used as microchimerism target.
