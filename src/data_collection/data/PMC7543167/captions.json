  "figure_1": "Microchimerism (Mc) in three generations. (a) Proband as infant (red) exchanges Mc with her mother (blue), resulting in maternal Mc in the infant and fetal Mc in the mother. (b) As an adult, proband (red) still harboring maternal Mc, experiences pregnancy herself (green) and acquires new source of fetal Mc. (c) Later, proband (red), child (green), and proband’s mother (blue), all with persistent Mc from maternal and/or fetal sources.\nNote: This figure is available in color in the online version of the journal article.Source: Reproduced with the permission of UPV/EHU Press from Gammill and Nelson (2010).2",
  "figure_2": "Fetal Y-chromosome used as microchimerism target. The pregnant woman has two X-chromosomes, whereas the male fetus has one maternally inherited X-chromosome and one paternally inherited Y-chromosome. This allows for microchimerism detection by FISH or by qPCR probes targeting the Y-chromosome (as shown here).",
  "figure_3": "Determining prevalence and quantity of fetal microchimerism. Using FISH or quantitative PCR, the prevalence and quantity of cFMC may be determined. The prevalence is obtained by identifying the number of women in each group that have detectable cFMC (individuals shown as shaded) relative to the number of women in each group in which cFMC is not detectable (individuals shown as unshaded) and comparing the two groups. The quantity of cFMC is determined by counting the number of fetal microchimeric cells present in a blood or tissue sample from each woman; the beakers represent blood samples from two different women containing different quantities of fetal microchimeric cells.",
  "figure_4": "Fetal HLA-polymorphisms used as microchimerism target. The highly polymorphic HLA Class II genes may be used to detect fetal microchimerism. The pregnant woman has two copies of the DRB1 gene, shown as allele 1 and allele 2. The fetus inherits one of these alleles from its biological mother, and one of the alleles from its biological father. The paternally inherited fetal allele may, as in this example, be different from the pregnant woman’s other allele, thereby providing a target for microchimerism detection."
