Adapted from PRISMA 2009 Flow Chart (The PRISMA Group, 2009). 208 full text articles excluded for the following reasons: assessed treatment-seekers only (n = 56); focus on general health status or other health problem (e.g., need for HIV care) (n = 28); mental health only, excludes substance use (n = 3); non-empirical, not relevant to assessment of need (n = 2); did not assess population need directly (e.g., survey of administrators' opinions on need) (n = 6); intervention study (n = 9); non-English (n = 14); not a journal article (e.g., commentary) (n = 17); full text could not be retrieved (n = 73)",./data/PMC5359989/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c93/5359989/0b533c8d984e/12913_2017_2153_Fig1_HTML.jpg
PMC5359989,Figure 4 illustrates how expert-defined need has been conceptualized in the literature on population need for substance use services.,PMC5359989_figure_4,Fig. 4.,"Percent of expert-defined service need studies using specific combinations of measures (n = 1534). Use refers to substance use prevalence, defined as an estimate of the population prevalence of one or more types of substance use. Note that ‘user-only’ studies (i.e., studies where eligibility criteria included substance use) were only coded as reporting a substance use prevalence estimate when survey data were combined with administrative data to estimate population prevalence of use. Diagnostic refers to diagnostic prevalence defined as meeting criteria for one or more substance use disorders or problematic patterns of substance use. Service use is defined as reporting use of one or more substance use services (general health, social, or specialty substance use and mental health services",./data/PMC5359989/images/figure_4.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c93/5359989/c6c3819dc64d/12913_2017_2153_Fig4_HTML.jpg
