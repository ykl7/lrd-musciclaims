(A) Minimum evolution phylogenetic tree constructed from pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ2) of abstract word frequencies from each year. Correlation coefficients were converted to dissimilarity scores (distances) for phylogenetic inference using FastMe (Lefort et al. 2015). Distances between two years α and β were evaluated as d(α,β)=1–­ρ2. (B) The two largest clusters obtained from clust (Abu-Jamous and Kelly, 2018preprint) analysis of the abstract word frequency data. (C) Wordle (http://www.wordle.net/) of the 100 most frequently used words from the decreasing cluster. (D) Wordle of the 100 most frequently used words from the increasing cluster.",
