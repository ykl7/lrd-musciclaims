  "figure_1": "Pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation. DIC is characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in generation and deposition of fibrin, leading to microvascular thrombi contributing to multi-organ dysfunction. Furthermore, consumption of clotting factors and platelets can result in life-threatening hemorrhage.",

  "figure_3": "Forest plots of the standardized mean difference in d-dimer levels. (A) Non severe vs Severe patients. The black squares represent the pooled standardized mean difference effect size for each analysis while the left and right extremes of the squares represent the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the pooled standardized mean difference effect size for each analysis. All analyses are based on a random-effects model. (B) Survivors vs Non-Survivors. The black squares represent the pooled standardized mean difference effect size for each analysis while the left and right extremes of the squares represent the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the pooled standardized mean difference effect size for each analysis. All analyses are based on a random-effects model.",

(A–C) Forest plots of the standard mean difference in PLT count, PT and aPTT between Non Severe and Severe patients. (D–F) Forest plots of the standard mean difference in PLT count, PT and aPTT between Survivors and Non-Survivors."
