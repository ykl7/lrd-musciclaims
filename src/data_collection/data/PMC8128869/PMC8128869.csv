PMC8128869,"Similarly, several patients with severe COVID-19 infection can develop a coagulopathy according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) with fulminant activation of coagulation4, resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors (Fig. 1).",PMC8128869_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation. DIC is characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in generation and deposition of fibrin, leading to microvascular thrombi contributing to multi-organ dysfunction. Furthermore, consumption of clotting factors and platelets can result in life-threatening hemorrhage.",./data/PMC8128869/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8364/8128869/602893971d33/41598_2021_89967_Fig1_HTML.jpg

PMC8128869,"The primary analysis showed that mean d-dimer is significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease than in those with severe infection (SMD − 2.15 [− 2.73 to − 1.56], I2 98%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, panel A).",PMC8128869_figure_3,Figure 3.,Forest plots of the standardized mean difference in d-dimer levels.

The black squares represent the pooled standardized mean difference effect size for each analysis while the left and right extremes of the squares represent the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the pooled standardized mean difference effect size for each analysis. All analyses are based on a random-effects model. (B) Survivors vs Non-Survivors.

PMC8128869,"Similarly, we found a much lower mean d-dimer in Survivors compared to Non-Survivors (SMD − 2.91 [− 3.87 to − 1.96], I2 98%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, panel B).",PMC8128869_figure_3,Figure 3.,Forest plots of the standardized mean difference in d-dimer levels.
