PMC8029445,"Like mammalian
mRNA, mRNA vaccines produced by in vitro transcription
(IVT) contain an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5′ and
3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), a 5′-cap, and a 3′
polyadenylation (poly(A)) tail, as shown in Figure 5.",PMC8029445_figure_5,Figure 5.,"Schematic illustration
of an mRNA molecule with the structural elements.",./data/PMC8029445/images/figure_5.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/526e/8155458/0cbf4ded9353/oc1c00120_0005.jpg
PMC8029445,"In addition,
without a cap, the IVT mRNA would be recognized as foreign RNA by
the host immune system through a mechanism mediated by Toll-like receptors
7/8.79 Capping of IVT mRNA would prevent
its recognition by the host immune system and reduce immunogenicity
caused by mRNA molecule itself.77,80
The elongated
poly (A) tail at the 3′ end is important for the stability
and subsequent translation of mRNA.81 Incorporation
of UTR sequences enhances mRNA half-life and translation efficiency.82 For example, incorporating a human β-globin
UTR to both 5′- and 3′-UTR of the mRNA has been shown
to enhance the stability and translational efficiency,83 whereas insertion of an α-globin UTR to
the 3′-UTR region increased the mRNA stability.84 Both 3′- and 5′-UTR regions can
also inhibit decapping and degradation of mRNA.83,84 As such, sequence modifications in both 5′- and 3′-UTRs
have been explored to enhance the mRNA vaccine functionality.85
In addition, unmodified IVT mRNA sequences
can stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate the innate immune
system.86 To reduce immunogenicity of the
IVT mRNA, a variety of modified nucleotides have been introduced into
the ORF region.86,87 For instance, designed incorporation
of pseudouridine (ψ) (Figure 6) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve
translation.88 Additionally, mRNA containing
N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1ψ) (Figure 6) exhibited an increase
in translational efficiency.89 Recent studies
have shown that this increase is related to N1-methyl-pseudouridine
induced enhancement of ribosome recycling to the same mRNA.90
