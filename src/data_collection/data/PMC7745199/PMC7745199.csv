PMC7745199,We identified 556 studies assessing interventions for COVID-19 (Fig. 1).,PMC7745199_figure_1,Fig. 1.,,./data/PMC7745199/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b3f/7745372/f6d374aa2821/12916_2020_1880_Fig1_HTML.jpg
PMC7745199,The median delay from publication of the first preprint version to publication of the associated journal article was 76 days (IQR 55–106) (Fig. 2).,PMC7745199_figure_2,Fig. 2.,"Survival plot depicting the probability of a preprint remaining unpublished as journal article for 338 studies initially published as preprints. This survival plot presents the probability that a study initially published as a preprint remains unpublished as a journal article. The x-axis represents the number of days elapsed since the preprint first appeared online. Of the 338 studies published as preprints from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to 15 August 2020, 66 had an associated journal article by 2 September 2020",./data/PMC7745199/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b3f/7745372/a8217d3d4834/12916_2020_1880_Fig2_HTML.jpg
PMC7745199,"In terms of changes among positive, neutral, and negative, the most common changes were from neutral to positive (n = 6) (Fig. 3).",PMC7745199_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Direction of changes in the abstract conclusion of 139 studies assessing preventive, treatment, or post-acute care interventions for COVID-19, from the first preprint version to the associated journal article or latest preprint version of each study. This Sankey diagram presents the changes made to the abstract conclusion for the same study, between the first preprint version on the left, and the latest available source version on the right (journal article or latest preprint version for studies that have not been published in a journal). The colored flow lines represent the direction of the change: green lines represent change from negative to neutral or positive, or from neutral to positive, and red lines represent change from positive or neutral to negative, and from positive to neutral",./data/PMC7745199/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b3f/7745372/f1ac9eab36dd/12916_2020_1880_Fig3_HTML.jpg
