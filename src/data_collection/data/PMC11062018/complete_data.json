The EQ-5D results were included in the humanistic burden SLR and the utility values from these studies were included in the economic burden SLR. cFour studies were retrieved from humanistic burden review as a part of bibliography. Some publications contained more than one economic study type; the numbers of publications by type are therefore not mutually exclusive. SGA, subgroup analysis",
