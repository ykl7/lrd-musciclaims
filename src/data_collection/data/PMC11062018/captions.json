ProQuest was utilized for initial review conducted in January 2020; for the refresh of the current review (conducted in January 2022) only Embase®, Cochrane, and PubMed were utilized, in line with the protocol. bIn addition to the assessment of QoL, four studies from the economic burden SLR reported utility values with EQ-5D index scale.
