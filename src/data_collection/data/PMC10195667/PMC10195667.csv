PMC10195667,"Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2019) published the article ‘Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology’ in Nature and proposed the Disruption index (abbreviated as D index, as shown in formula 1), which measures the disruption by calculating the citation substitution of focus papers in the citation network (as shown in Fig. 1, the single arrow indicates the citation relationship, with the end of the arrow connecting the cited literature and the tip of the arrow connecting the reference).",PMC10195667_figure_1,Fig. 1.,Classification of citation types,./data/PMC10195667/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/47d4/10195667/b1ca5092f201/11192_2023_4737_Fig1_HTML.jpg
