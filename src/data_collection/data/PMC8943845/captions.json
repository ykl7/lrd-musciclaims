  "figure_2": "Perennial streams (P) are assumed to always have flow in a typical year and are considered WOTUS (Waters of the United States) if they contribute surface water to navigable waters (a). Typical flow is defined as having precipitation that is within the 30th and 70th percentile based on the previous 30 years. Intermittent streams (I) are considered WOTUS if they contribute surface water to navigable waters in a typical year regardless of whether they are flowing (a) or dry (b). Ephemeral streams (E) are never considered WOTUS (c,d). If a perennial or intermittent stream (P/I) is flowing into an ephemeral stream that flows during a typical year, then the perennial or intermittent stream is considered WOTUS (c), whereas if a perennial or intermittent (P/I) stream is flowing into an ephemeral stream that is always dry in a typical year, that upstream stream is not considered WOTUS (d).",
  "figure_3": "Map (a) of USGS NHDPlus V2.1 stream gaging network in CONUS [52] and wet/dry observations aggregated from stream survey incidental information [53,54], EPA probabilistic stream surveys, dedicated streamflow permanence surveys via mobile applications CrowdWater [55], Stream Tracker [56], and FLOwPER [57,58], and EPA probabilistic stream surveys (NRSA 2008–2009 and 2013–2014, WSA-Western EMAP 2000–2004, EMAP Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment 1993–1996, Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment 1997–1998, Kansas Regional EMAP 2001, and Eastern Cornbelt Regional EMAP 1995) [59], and density plots (b) of wet/dry observations, gages, and NHDPlus V2.1 flowlines in CONUS [52] drainage areas less than 100 km2.",
  "figure_4": "Time series of surface water presence observations colored by source. Note, only CrowdWater observations located in the United States and shown in Figure 3 are included here. McShane et al. [53] and York et al. [54] are flow/no flow observation datasets originally aggregated from several local, state, tribal, and federal agencies to support PROSPER model development.",
  "figure_5": "Examples of the challenge of assigning field observation to a stream network, in this case, the NHD High Resolution flowline and NHD High Resolution flow accumulation stream grid. Red triangles are original points, pink triangles are the point snapped to the closest NHD High Resolution flowline, and green triangles are the final processed locations on the NHD High Resolution flowlines and flow accumulation derived stream grid network. (a) An observation collected near a valley bottom is near the mainstem and a tributary that intersects the road. (b) Inset of (a). The original point is closer to the mainstem NHD flowline, though the snapping distance to the tributary is nearly equal. Information interpreted from the FLOwPER field form indicates that the observation should be assigned to the tributary. (c) Two observations collected in the headwaters along a road. (d) Inset of (c). The two original points are both closest to the flowline to the east. However, information interpreted from the FLOwPER field form and interpretation of the map indicate that the western observation should be assigned to the western tributary."
