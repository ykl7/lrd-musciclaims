PMC8943845,"Given the abundance of non-perennial streams both within the U.S. (Figure 1) and globally [11], and the prospect of declining stream flows in the future [16,27,28], accurately characterizing streamflow permanence represents a major challenge to understanding water availability now and throughout the 21st century [24,25].",PMC8943845_figure_1,Figure 1.,Maps showing the distribution of perennial (a) and non-perennial (b) streams in the Continuous United States (CONUS) from the U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High-Resolution Hydrography [32] and the total and relative lengths of each category (c).,./data/PMC8943845/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fc1f/8943845/c8569f088c29/nihms-1727490-f0001.jpg
PMC8943845,"Consequently, there have been several recent calls to fill this critical data gap [29–31], with van Meerveld et al. [31] aptly likening the lack of knowledge of non-perennial headwater streams to, “a puzzle with most pieces still under the carpet.”

PMC8943845,"As of June 2020, the federal policy defining WOTUS (“Navigable Waters Protection Rule,” [9]) considers jurisdictional tributaries as those that are perennial or intermittent (Table 1) and contribute surface water flow to a traditional navigable water or territorial sea in a typical year (Figure 2).",PMC8943845_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Perennial streams (P) are assumed to always have flow in a typical year and are considered WOTUS (Waters of the United States) if they contribute surface water to navigable waters (a). Typical flow is defined as having precipitation that is within the 30th and 70th percentile based on the previous 30 years. Intermittent streams (I) are considered WOTUS if they contribute surface water to navigable waters in a typical year regardless of whether they are flowing (a) or dry (b). Ephemeral streams (E) are never considered WOTUS (c,d). If a perennial or intermittent stream (P/I) is flowing into an ephemeral stream that flows during a typical year, then the perennial or intermittent stream is considered WOTUS (c), whereas if a perennial or intermittent (P/I) stream is flowing into an ephemeral stream that is always dry in a typical year, that upstream stream is not considered WOTUS (d).",./data/PMC8943845/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fc1f/8943845/a9d4c8afb7c6/nihms-1727490-f0002.jpg
PMC8943845,"The rule includes upstream perennial and intermittent streams that have connections to downstream WOTUS through ephemeral streams or breaks, but only if the connecting ephemeral stream carries flow in a typical year (Figure 2c), otherwise the upstream perennial and intermittent streams are excluded from WOTUS (Figure 2d, [8]).",PMC8943845_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Perennial streams (P) are assumed to always have flow in a typical year and are considered WOTUS (Waters of the United States) if they contribute surface water to navigable waters (a).

PMC8943845,"Here, we highlight that the particular details on surface flow timing and spatial configuration of flowing and nonflowing stream segments relative to each other (e.g., Figure 2c,d) further underscores the need for tools that include accurate mapping and modeling of surface flow presence/absence to implement policies and management decisions (e.g., jurisdictional determinations, water quality standards, riparian buffer rules) based on surface flow regime and network position.",PMC8943845_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Perennial streams (P) are assumed to always have flow in a typical year and are considered WOTUS (Waters of the United States) if they contribute surface water to navigable waters (a).

PMC8943845,"Consequently, databases are often siloed within the host agency and can remain either unknown or not readily available for access outside the agency, even though they may be the only streamflow information for this part of the stream network (Figure 3).",PMC8943845_figure_3,Figure 3.,"Map (a) of USGS NHDPlus V2.1 stream gaging network in CONUS [52] and wet/dry observations aggregated from stream survey incidental information [53,54], EPA probabilistic stream surveys, dedicated streamflow permanence surveys via mobile applications CrowdWater [55], Stream Tracker [56], and FLOwPER [57,58], and EPA probabilistic stream surveys (NRSA 2008–2009 and 2013–2014, WSA-Western EMAP 2000–2004, EMAP Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment 1993–1996, Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment 1997–1998, Kansas Regional EMAP 2001, and Eastern Cornbelt Regional EMAP 1995) [59], and density plots (b) of wet/dry observations, gages, and NHDPlus V2.1 flowlines in CONUS [52] drainage areas less than 100 km2.",./data/PMC8943845/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fc1f/8943845/61699e1565cd/nihms-1727490-f0003.jpg
PMC8943845,These efforts provide an opportunity for rapid data collection over potentially extensive geographic regions as a low-cost approach toward filling this data gap to characterize streamflow permanence (Figure 3).,PMC8943845_figure_3,Figure 3.,"Map (a) of USGS NHDPlus V2.1 stream gaging network in CONUS [52] and wet/dry observations aggregated from stream survey incidental information [53,54], EPA probabilistic stream surveys, dedicated streamflow permanence surveys via mobile applications CrowdWater [55], Stream Tracker [56], and FLOwPER [57,58], and EPA probabilistic stream surveys (NRSA 2008–2009 and 2013–2014, WSA-Western EMAP 2000–2004, EMAP Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment 1993–1996, Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment 1997–1998, Kansas Regional EMAP 2001, and Eastern Cornbelt Regional EMAP 1995) [59], and density plots (b) of wet/dry observations, gages, and NHDPlus V2.1 flowlines in CONUS [52] drainage areas less than 100 km2.",./data/PMC8943845/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fc1f/8943845/61699e1565cd/nihms-1727490-f0003.jpg
PMC8943845,Crowdsourcing can be an effective mechanism for rapidly generating sizable datasets on streamflow permanence that rival or exceed existing datasets derived from other agency surveys (Figure 4).,PMC8943845_figure_4,Figure 4.,"Time series of surface water presence observations colored by source.

PMC8943845,"However, in many headwater locations, identifying the appropriate flowline or stream grid cell can be difficult, especially with an automated approach, if multiple potential stream features may be relatively close to the observation location (Figure 5).",PMC8943845_figure_5,Figure 5.,"Examples of the challenge of assigning field observation to a stream network, in this case, the NHD High Resolution flowline and NHD High Resolution flow accumulation stream grid.

(a) An observation collected near a valley bottom is near the mainstem and a tributary that intersects the road. (b) Inset of (a). The original point is closer to the mainstem NHD flowline, though the snapping distance to the tributary is nearly equal. Information interpreted from the FLOwPER field form indicates that the observation should be assigned to the tributary. (c) Two observations collected in the headwaters along a road. (d) Inset of (c). The two original points are both closest to the flowline to the east. However, information interpreted from the FLOwPER field form and interpretation of the map indicate that the western observation should be assigned to the western tributary.",./data/PMC8943845/images/figure_5.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fc1f/8943845/2c41fd12df2e/nihms-1727490-f0005.jpg
