Curves are shown for the updated analysis that includes all available data (solid purple lines), and for analysis including only newly identified studies published after the WHO review19 (dashed green lines). Data are calculated as the combined response using average responses of the awakening, falling asleep, and sleep disturbance questions within studies, determined as the within-study average of disturbance questions that explicitly mentioned noise as the source of sleep disturbance. Parameter estimates were calculated in logistic regression models with  included as the only fixed effect and study included as a random effect, restricted to the noise exposure range 40–65 dB . Models were run separately for each traffic mode. Note: , nighttime noise; WHO, World Health Organization."
