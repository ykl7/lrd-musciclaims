  "figure_3": "Forest plot for all included effects of risky decision-making and emotion-related impulsivity. Point estimates (squares) with 95% confidence intervals (horizontal lines) are sorted from strongest positive (top) to strongest negative (bottom). Positive effect sizes are those that found high risky decision-making correlating with high emotion-related impulsivity. Solid vertical line represents the pooled effect, estimated by intercept-only meta-regression. Dashed vertical lines represent the 95% confidence interval for the pooled effect.",

Point estimates (squares) with 95% confidence intervals (horizontal lines) are sorted from strongest positive (top) to strongest negative (bottom). Positive effect sizes are those that found high risky decision-making correlating with high emotion-related impulsivity. Solid vertical line represents the pooled effect, estimated by moderated meta-regression. Dashed vertical lines represent the 95% confidence interval for the pooled effect.",

Point estimates (squares) with 95% confidence intervals (horizontal lines) are sorted from strongest positive (top) to strongest negative (bottom). Positive effect sizes are those that found high risky decision-making correlating with high emotion-related impulsivity. Solid vertical line represents the pooled effect, estimated by moderated meta-regression. Dashed vertical lines represent the 95% confidence interval for the pooled effect.",

Dotted diagonal lines (interior) represent the 95% confidence interval. Dashed diagonal lines (exterior) represent the 99% confidence interval."
