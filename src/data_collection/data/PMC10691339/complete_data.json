The proposed framework captures the impact of disease dynamics on the detection time of an emergent/imported variant, which in turn limits the fastest intervention time against the novel variant. The detection time and, consequently, the response time are dependent on the variants’ competing dynamics, whose dynamics are determined by the relative infectiousness and the cross-infection levels. Finally, the goal-specific best intervention scenario is given by the intervention length, the intervention time, and the intervention strength.",
