  "figure_01": "A schematic of our detection and response framework. The proposed framework captures the impact of disease dynamics on the detection time of an emergent/imported variant, which in turn limits the fastest intervention time against the novel variant. The detection time and, consequently, the response time are dependent on the variants’ competing dynamics, whose dynamics are determined by the relative infectiousness and the cross-infection levels. Finally, the goal-specific best intervention scenario is given by the intervention length, the intervention time, and the intervention strength.",
  "figure_02": "The impact of the importation time on the second variant detection and dominance times. The second variant’s detection and dominance times show a maximum as a function of the importation time (), panel A. Cross-infection (), impacts the second variant’s detection time for intermediate and delayed importation times, but not for early importation times, panel B. We assume  infectiousness advantage for the second variant, one-way cross-immunity ( and ),  sequences per week, and first variant’s basic reproductive number .",
  "figure_03": "Second variant’s peak size as a function of the response time, the response strength, and the cross-infection level. Early and strong single-period responses increase the second variant peak size; in counterpart, delayed and intermediate response strengths are best (panel A). The biggest reduction of the second variant’s peak size is attained for importation times near the first variant’s peak time (panel B). We assume the second variant’s importation times  and , first variant’s , one-way cross-infection, where  and , and 4 wks’ intervention length.",
  "figure_04": "Total disease prevalence as a function of the response time and response strength. Early importation produces coupled dynamics and, the best response time is delayed until the second variant overcomes the first variant (A). Delayed importation produces decoupled dynamics, and the best response time is delayed until the second variant exponentially grows (B).",
  "figure_05": "Total cumulative cases as a function of the response time and response strength. For the scenarios of the second variant being imported before the peak time of the first variant, interventions targeting the cumulative cases of the first variant minimize the total number of cases (A). For these scenarios, quick and strong single-period responses are best. In counterpart, for scenarios of the second variant importation during or after the first variant’s peak time, interventions targeting the cumulative cases of the second variant minimize the total number of cases (B). For these scenarios, delayed and strong single-period responses are best."
