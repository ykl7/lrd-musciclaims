PMC11410256,"At the start of each No Mimicry block conditions, participants were shown an image of a face holding a pen between their teeth and were instructed, “For the entire duration of this block, please position the object as shown below and hold it there while you complete the trials.” At the start of each Spontaneous Mimicry conditions, participants were shown an image of a face with a neutral expression and no pen, paired with the instruction, “For the entire duration of this block, please make sure the object is removed from your mouth and keep your face relaxed into its normal state.”
The same face identities were presented in both the No Mimicry and the Spontaneous Mimicry conditions.Procedure
