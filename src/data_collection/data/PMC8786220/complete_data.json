Arm elevation is shown with the humerus motion decomposed using the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) yx’y’ ’ sequence (top left) and scapular motion decomposed using the ISB yx’z’ ’ sequence (top right). The 3D “Preview” view (bottom left) visualizes the simultaneous motion of the humerus and scapula. The 2D kinematic curves typically presented in peer-reviewed articles are also presented (bottom right).",
