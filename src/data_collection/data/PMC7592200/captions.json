  "figure_1": "Scaled diagrams of tricladivirus genomes. Overall lengths of the assembled contigs are indicated at the right (in nucleotides). The genomic RNA plus strand of each virus is shown as a thick red line. The three long ORFs in each virus (ORF0, -1, and -2) are shown as gray rectangles, labeled with the first and last nucleotide positions of each (including stop codons) in black. Evidence that ORF1 and ORF2 encode the viral CP and RdRp is described in the text. The reading frame that includes ORF1 is defined as frame 0, as labeled at left. The first in-frame AUG codon in each ORF is shown as a green line and labeled with the first nucleotide position. The proposed +1 ribosomal frameshifting site (+1fs) in the region of ORF1-ORF2 overlap in each virus is also indicated. The diagrams for the five viruses are aligned by the position of the ORF1 stop codon. The diagram for SmedTV is that for a consensus determined from the originally identified TSA and PlanMine sequences.

  "figure_2": "Unrooted radial phylograms. For each phylogram, aligned sequences were subjected to maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses using ModelFinder, IQ-TREE, and UFBoot (57) as implemented with the “Find best and apply” option at https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/IQTREE/iqtree.html. Branch support values (from 1,000 bootstrap replicates) are shown as percentages; branches with support values of <70% have been collapsed to the preceding node. Scale bar indicates average number of substitutions per alignment position. (A) Deduced amino acid sequences of the translated ORF2 (RdRp) regions of each virus were aligned using MAFFT 7 (L-INS-i). The following were found to apply by ModelFinder: best-fit model according to BIC, LG+F+R5; model of rate heterogeneity, FreeRate with five categories; site proportion and rates, 0.0183 and 0.0138, 0.0662 and 0.1754, 0.2240 and 0.4485, 0.4203 and 0.9564, and 0.2712 and 1.7908, respectively. See Table S2 for summary of virus names, abbreviations, and RefSeq accession numbers. Three putative arthropod viruses branching nearest to the tricladiviruses are labeled in orange. The only formally assigned Totiviridae member with sufficient sequence similarity to appear in the tree, GLV, is labeled in cyan. Tentatively assigned totiviruses LbTV, PCMV1, and PCMV2, identified as being related to the tricladiviruses in BLASTX searches as described in the text, are labeled in green. Viruses that have been previously shown to form isometric viral capsids are marked with hexagons. (B) Nucleotide sequences of 11 newly assembled SmedTV strain sequences were aligned using MAFFT 7 (L-INS-i). The following was found to apply by ModelFinder: best-fit model according to BIC, HKY+I. The designated virus names reflect information from the respective BioProject metadata: the S. mediterranea strain name as annotated in either the metadata or an associated journal article, followed by an abbreviation for the reporting institution and the registration date(s) for the respective BioProject(s).",
  "figure_3": "Detection of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms. (A) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in the head region of worms. (Top) Separate riboprobes for detecting the SmedTV minus-strand RNA (antisense [AS]; magenta) and plus-strand RNA (sense [SE]; green) were used and showed consistent colocalization in the same cells, as expected. The area surrounded by a dotted box in each panel is enlarged in each inset to highlight this colocalization. (Middle) Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; magenta) is included, coupled with staining for the SmedTV plus-strand RNA (green). The areas surrounded by dotted boxes 1, 2, and 3 are enlarged in the insets to highlight colocalization of the two stains. (Bottom) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms, with staining of discrete cells but in differing numbers between worms from “low” (left) and “high” (right) cultures. Here, enrichment in eyespots is more evident in the low worm and enrichment in other neural structures (brain lobes) is more evident in the high worm (eyespots obscured). (B) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in brain lobes and eyespots. (Top [worm from low culture] and middle [worm from high culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (magenta) are visible in 20-μm Z-stacks of sectioned brain lobes (sections taken just posterior to the eyespots; brain lobes outlined with dotted lines), in some cases colocalizing in cells with the cholinergic neuron marker ChAT (green). (Bottom [worm from low culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (green) are also concentrated in eyespots, colocalizing in cells with the photoreceptor marker opsin (magenta). (C) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in stem cell-rich compartments in worm trunk regions. Staining for piwi-1 (magenta) identifies numerous stem cells in this field. Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1. The area surrounded by a dotted box is enlarged in the bottom row to show lack of colocalization between SmedTV and piwi-1, suggesting their respective presence in distinct cells. (D) Graphic illustration of previously reported single-cell RNA-seq data represented in violin plots for levels of sequence reads from SmedTV on the y axis and cell type on the x axis. SmedTV levels are higher in multiple, but not all, differentiated tissue types. Data in the lighter-shaded area are from Molinaro and Pearson (32) (head enriched), and data in the darker-shaded area are from Wurtzel et al. (31) (postpharyngeal). The generally higher levels of SmedTV seen in the Pearson lab data could be due to differences in tissue selectivity or culture conditions. (E and F) Analyses based on RNA-seq data from >50,000 single cells of S. mediterranea CIW4 (Reddien lab) in the planarian Digiworm atlas (33). An initial t-SNE expression profile plot (E) was regenerated for all cells in the atlas, and positions of 100 cells with the highest numbers of sequence reads from SmedTV are marked as red dots (top 25 cells) or cyan dots (next 75 cells). Outlines indicate previously identified clusters representing eight worm tissue classes (33): 1, neural; 2, protonephridia; 3, cathepsin+ cells; 4, epidermal; 5, pharynx; 6, intestine; 7, neoblast (stem cell); 8, parenchymal; and 9, muscle. A heat map (F) was regenerated for the 22 top SmedTV-expressing cells that clustered within the all-neural class of the atlas. Expression of selected marker genes (ciliated neuron [rootletin], pan-neural [pc-2], head sensory neurons [gpas], cholingerigic neurons [ChAT], photoreceptor [opsin], and stem cell [piwi-1]) are shown in rows. Cells (in columns) are ordered by SmedTV expression from highest to lowest.",
  "figure_4": "Potential regulators of SmedTV expression. WISH and qPCR analysis of SmedTV expression following different experimental conditions. (A) Knockdown of stem cells by combining piwi-1, -2, and 3 RNAi (top) or by lethal irradiation (bottom) had no effect on SmedTV expression. qPCR confirmation of knockdown of piwi-1, -2, and -3 and quantification of SmedTV expression are shown on the right. Normalized gene expression was calculated for worms following GFP(RNAi) or piwi-1,2,3(RNAi) knockdown at 4 days after the third feeding (3fd4) (as in panel A). Note that despite robust knockdown of piwi-1,2,3, no difference was observed in SmedTV expression levels. (B) RNAi knockdown of dsRNA helicase enzyme-encoding gene, RIG-I, does not affect expression. qPCR confirmation of knockdown of RIG-1 is shown on the right. Normalized gene expression of RIG-I and SmedTV following GFP(RNAi) or RIG-I(RNAi) knockdown was analyzed at 5fd11 (as in Fig. S7B, left and middle). Note that despite robust knockdown of RIG-1, no difference was observed in SmedTV expression levels. (C) Confocal image of combined FISH for SmedTV expression (green) and TUNEL (magenta) staining. An example of a doubly positive cell is shown on the left. An additional example illustrating that this is a rare occurrence (2/51 TUNEL-positive cells) shown on the right. Note that TUNEL-positive cells do not to double with SmedTV.",
  "figure_5": "Detection of SmedTV-staining cells in regenerating, dsRNA-fed, and homogenate-injected worms. (A) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in regenerating trunk fragments. Dotted line represents plane of amputation in each panel with tissue above (head panels) or below (tail panels) being newly regenerated. SmedTV-staining cells are largely absent from the regenerating tissues until 9 dpa, with robust expression evident by 14 dpa; arrowheads highlight weakly positive cells in the regenerating tissues at 7 dpa. (B) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in worms following a GFP(RNAi) or SmedTV(RNAi) feeding-plus-regeneration regimen (see the text). The worms shown here were analyzed at 90 days after feeding 10 (10fd90). Very few, if any, SmedTV-staining cells are visible in the SmedTV(RNAi) worm. (C) Image of an ethidium bromide (EtBr) agarose gel under UV light (colors inverted for clarity) following electrophoresis to visualize amplicons (or lack thereof) resulting from 33 cycles of PCR using SmedTV-specific (expected amplicon size of ∼1.6 kb, indicated by a solid black arrowhead) and piwi-3-specific (expected amplicon size of ∼1.8 kb, indicated by an open arrowhead) primers on cDNA generated from RNA isolated from control and SmedTV RNAi-treated worms. Lanes 1 and 15 contain a 1-kb DNA ladder. Lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 were run empty for spacing of experimental samples. Lane pairs (3/4, 6/7, 9/10, and 12/13) represent wild-type control, 7-RNAi-feed, 10-RNAi-feed, and 15-RNAi-feed SmedTV RNAi samples, respectively. The first lane of each pair contains the SmedTV reaction, and the piwi-3 positive control is in the second. Note that relative to the control (lane 3), the SmedTV band reduces until no longer detectable (lanes 6, 9, and 12), while the piwi-3 amplicon remains unchanged across all samples (lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13). (D) WISH analysis of SmedTV in S. polychroa following no or 10 injections of homogenates from S. mediterranea strain CIW4 (Pearson lab). No SmedTV-staining cells are visible in either worm.",
  "figure_6": "Diagram of proposed SmedTV infection cycle in S. mediterranea asexual strains. The outer circle of images shows manual fission of a mother worm (left) into head (top) and tail (bottom) fragments, followed by regeneration and morphallaxis (remodeling) and then growth to yield two full-sized progeny worms (right). Circled cutaways reveal the gut branches (violet) and stem cell-rich compartments (green) in the worm at left and the optic cup (magenta) and brain lobe (cyan) in the worm at right. Across the middle of the diagram, SmedTV is represented by red hexagons and is illustrated to be present at low levels in stem cells and their immediate progeny but at higher levels in a subset of differentiated cells (shown here as higher in a photoreceptor and another neuron but not in an epithelial cell). As additionally explained in the text, we propose that SmedTV is present in most or all stem cells and their immediate progeny, but its replication/expression is repressed to lower levels until derepression occurs along certain differentiation lineages as worms undergo regeneration, morphallaxis, and growth."
