PMC7592200,"In one set of experiments, dFISH was performed using dual riboprobes to detect both the plus and the minus strands of SmedTV, designed to nonoverlapping regions of the viral genome (Fig. 3A, top row).",PMC7592200_figure_3,FIG 3.,"Detection of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms. (A) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in the head region of worms. (Top) Separate riboprobes for detecting the SmedTV minus-strand RNA (antisense [AS]; magenta) and plus-strand RNA (sense [SE]; green) were used and showed consistent colocalization in the same cells, as expected. The area surrounded by a dotted box in each panel is enlarged in each inset to highlight this colocalization. (Middle) Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; magenta) is included, coupled with staining for the SmedTV plus-strand RNA (green). The areas surrounded by dotted boxes 1, 2, and 3 are enlarged in the insets to highlight colocalization of the two stains. (Bottom) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms, with staining of discrete cells but in differing numbers between worms from “low” (left) and “high” (right) cultures. Here, enrichment in eyespots is more evident in the low worm and enrichment in other neural structures (brain lobes) is more evident in the high worm (eyespots obscured). (B) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in brain lobes and eyespots. (Top [worm from low culture] and middle [worm from high culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (magenta) are visible in 20-μm Z-stacks of sectioned brain lobes (sections taken just posterior to the eyespots; brain lobes outlined with dotted lines), in some cases colocalizing in cells with the cholinergic neuron marker ChAT (green). (Bottom [worm from low culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (green) are also concentrated in eyespots, colocalizing in cells with the photoreceptor marker opsin (magenta). (C) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in stem cell-rich compartments in worm trunk regions. Staining for piwi-1 (magenta) identifies numerous stem cells in this field. Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1. The area surrounded by a dotted box is enlarged in the bottom row to show lack of colocalization between SmedTV and piwi-1, suggesting their respective presence in distinct cells. (D) Graphic illustration of previously reported single-cell RNA-seq data represented in violin plots for levels of sequence reads from SmedTV on the y axis and cell type on the x axis. SmedTV levels are higher in multiple, but not all, differentiated tissue types. Data in the lighter-shaded area are from Molinaro and Pearson (32) (head enriched), and data in the darker-shaded area are from Wurtzel et al. (31) (postpharyngeal). The generally higher levels of SmedTV seen in the Pearson lab data could be due to differences in tissue selectivity or culture conditions. (E and F) Analyses based on RNA-seq data from >50,000 single cells of S. mediterranea CIW4 (Reddien lab) in the planarian Digiworm atlas (33). An initial t-SNE expression profile plot (E) was regenerated for all cells in the atlas, and positions of 100 cells with the highest numbers of sequence reads from SmedTV are marked as red dots (top 25 cells) or cyan dots (next 75 cells).

(A) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in the head region of worms. (Top) Separate riboprobes for detecting the SmedTV minus-strand RNA (antisense [AS]; magenta) and plus-strand RNA (sense [SE]; green) were used and showed consistent colocalization in the same cells, as expected. The area surrounded by a dotted box in each panel is enlarged in each inset to highlight this colocalization. (Middle) Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; magenta) is included, coupled with staining for the SmedTV plus-strand RNA (green). The areas surrounded by dotted boxes 1, 2, and 3 are enlarged in the insets to highlight colocalization of the two stains. (Bottom) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms, with staining of discrete cells but in differing numbers between worms from “low” (left) and “high” (right) cultures. Here, enrichment in eyespots is more evident in the low worm and enrichment in other neural structures (brain lobes) is more evident in the high worm (eyespots obscured). (B) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in brain lobes and eyespots. (Top [worm from low culture] and middle [worm from high culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (magenta) are visible in 20-μm Z-stacks of sectioned brain lobes (sections taken just posterior to the eyespots; brain lobes outlined with dotted lines), in some cases colocalizing in cells with the cholinergic neuron marker ChAT (green). (Bottom [worm from low culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (green) are also concentrated in eyespots, colocalizing in cells with the photoreceptor marker opsin (magenta). (C) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in stem cell-rich compartments in worm trunk regions. Staining for piwi-1 (magenta) identifies numerous stem cells in this field. Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1. The area surrounded by a dotted box is enlarged in the bottom row to show lack of colocalization between SmedTV and piwi-1, suggesting their respective presence in distinct cells. (D) Graphic illustration of previously reported single-cell RNA-seq data represented in violin plots for levels of sequence reads from SmedTV on the y axis and cell type on the x axis. SmedTV levels are higher in multiple, but not all, differentiated tissue types. Data in the lighter-shaded area are from Molinaro and Pearson (32) (head enriched), and data in the darker-shaded area are from Wurtzel et al. (31) (postpharyngeal). The generally higher levels of SmedTV seen in the Pearson lab data could be due to differences in tissue selectivity or culture conditions. (E and F) Analyses based on RNA-seq data from >50,000 single cells of S. mediterranea CIW4 (Reddien lab) in the planarian Digiworm atlas (33). An initial t-SNE expression profile plot (E) was regenerated for all cells in the atlas, and positions of 100 cells with the highest numbers of sequence reads from SmedTV are marked as red dots (top 25 cells) or cyan dots (next 75 cells). Outlines indicate previously identified clusters representing eight worm tissue classes (33): 1, neural; 2, protonephridia; 3, cathepsin+ cells; 4, epidermal; 5, pharynx; 6, intestine; 7, neoblast (stem cell); 8, parenchymal; and 9, muscle. A heat map (F) was regenerated for the 22 top SmedTV-expressing cells that clustered within the all-neural class of the atlas.

(Bottom) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms, with staining of discrete cells but in differing numbers between worms from “low” (left) and “high” (right) cultures. Here, enrichment in eyespots is more evident in the low worm and enrichment in other neural structures (brain lobes) is more evident in the high worm (eyespots obscured). (B) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in brain lobes and eyespots. (Top [worm from low culture] and middle [worm from high culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (magenta) are visible in 20-μm Z-stacks of sectioned brain lobes (sections taken just posterior to the eyespots; brain lobes outlined with dotted lines), in some cases colocalizing in cells with the cholinergic neuron marker ChAT (green). (Bottom [worm from low culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (green) are also concentrated in eyespots, colocalizing in cells with the photoreceptor marker opsin (magenta). (C) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in stem cell-rich compartments in worm trunk regions. Staining for piwi-1 (magenta) identifies numerous stem cells in this field. Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1. The area surrounded by a dotted box is enlarged in the bottom row to show lack of colocalization between SmedTV and piwi-1, suggesting their respective presence in distinct cells. (D) Graphic illustration of previously reported single-cell RNA-seq data represented in violin plots for levels of sequence reads from SmedTV on the y axis and cell type on the x axis. SmedTV levels are higher in multiple, but not all, differentiated tissue types. Data in the lighter-shaded area are from Molinaro and Pearson (32) (head enriched), and data in the darker-shaded area are from Wurtzel et al. (31) (postpharyngeal). The generally higher levels of SmedTV seen in the Pearson lab data could be due to differences in tissue selectivity or culture conditions. (E and F) Analyses based on RNA-seq data from >50,000 single cells of S. mediterranea CIW4 (Reddien lab) in the planarian Digiworm atlas (33). An initial t-SNE expression profile plot (E) was regenerated for all cells in the atlas, and positions of 100 cells with the highest numbers of sequence reads from SmedTV are marked as red dots (top 25 cells) or cyan dots (next 75 cells).

A heat map (F) was regenerated for the 22 top SmedTV-expressing cells that clustered within the all-neural class of the atlas.
