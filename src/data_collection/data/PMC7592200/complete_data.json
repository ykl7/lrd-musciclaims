The genomic RNA plus strand of each virus is shown as a thick red line. The three long ORFs in each virus (ORF0, -1, and -2) are shown as gray rectangles, labeled with the first and last nucleotide positions of each (including stop codons) in black. Evidence that ORF1 and ORF2 encode the viral CP and RdRp is described in the text. The reading frame that includes ORF1 is defined as frame 0, as labeled at left. The first in-frame AUG codon in each ORF is shown as a green line and labeled with the first nucleotide position. The proposed +1 ribosomal frameshifting site (+1fs) in the region of ORF1-ORF2 overlap in each virus is also indicated. The diagrams for the five viruses are aligned by the position of the ORF1 stop codon. The diagram for SmedTV is that for a consensus determined from the originally identified TSA and PlanMine sequences.

Branch support values (from 1,000 bootstrap replicates) are shown as percentages; branches with support values of <70% have been collapsed to the preceding node. Scale bar indicates average number of substitutions per alignment position. (A) Deduced amino acid sequences of the translated ORF2 (RdRp) regions of each virus were aligned using MAFFT 7 (L-INS-i).

(Top) Separate riboprobes for detecting the SmedTV minus-strand RNA (antisense [AS]; magenta) and plus-strand RNA (sense [SE]; green) were used and showed consistent colocalization in the same cells, as expected. The area surrounded by a dotted box in each panel is enlarged in each inset to highlight this colocalization. (Middle) Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; magenta) is included, coupled with staining for the SmedTV plus-strand RNA (green). The areas surrounded by dotted boxes 1, 2, and 3 are enlarged in the insets to highlight colocalization of the two stains. (Bottom) WISH analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in untreated worms, with staining of discrete cells but in differing numbers between worms from “low” (left) and “high” (right) cultures. Here, enrichment in eyespots is more evident in the low worm and enrichment in other neural structures (brain lobes) is more evident in the high worm (eyespots obscured). (B) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in brain lobes and eyespots. (Top [worm from low culture] and middle [worm from high culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (magenta) are visible in 20-μm Z-stacks of sectioned brain lobes (sections taken just posterior to the eyespots; brain lobes outlined with dotted lines), in some cases colocalizing in cells with the cholinergic neuron marker ChAT (green). (Bottom [worm from low culture]): SmedTV-staining cells (green) are also concentrated in eyespots, colocalizing in cells with the photoreceptor marker opsin (magenta). (C) dFISH confocal analysis of SmedTV-staining cells in stem cell-rich compartments in worm trunk regions. Staining for piwi-1 (magenta) identifies numerous stem cells in this field. Staining for SmedTV (green), in contrast, is limited to few cells, which generally do not appear to express piwi-1. The area surrounded by a dotted box is enlarged in the bottom row to show lack of colocalization between SmedTV and piwi-1, suggesting their respective presence in distinct cells. (D) Graphic illustration of previously reported single-cell RNA-seq data represented in violin plots for levels of sequence reads from SmedTV on the y axis and cell type on the x axis. SmedTV levels are higher in multiple, but not all, differentiated tissue types. Data in the lighter-shaded area are from Molinaro and Pearson (32) (head enriched), and data in the darker-shaded area are from Wurtzel et al. (31) (postpharyngeal). The generally higher levels of SmedTV seen in the Pearson lab data could be due to differences in tissue selectivity or culture conditions. (E and F) Analyses based on RNA-seq data from >50,000 single cells of S. mediterranea CIW4 (Reddien lab) in the planarian Digiworm atlas (33). An initial t-SNE expression profile plot (E) was regenerated for all cells in the atlas, and positions of 100 cells with the highest numbers of sequence reads from SmedTV are marked as red dots (top 25 cells) or cyan dots (next 75 cells). Outlines indicate previously identified clusters representing eight worm tissue classes (33): 1, neural; 2, protonephridia; 3, cathepsin+ cells; 4, epidermal; 5, pharynx; 6, intestine; 7, neoblast (stem cell); 8, parenchymal; and 9, muscle. A heat map (F) was regenerated for the 22 top SmedTV-expressing cells that clustered within the all-neural class of the atlas. Expression of selected marker genes (ciliated neuron [rootletin], pan-neural [pc-2], head sensory neurons [gpas], cholingerigic neurons [ChAT], photoreceptor [opsin], and stem cell [piwi-1]) are shown in rows. Cells (in columns) are ordered by SmedTV expression from highest to lowest.",
