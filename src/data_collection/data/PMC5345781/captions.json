Preliminary: presentation was preliminary work for a larger ongoing study. Co-author: difficulty with co-authors. Another: responsibility of writing the manuscript belonged to someone else. Methods: a low likelihood that a journal would accept it for publication because of methodological limitations of the work. No release: no release time was granted to work on the manuscript. Case study: the presentation was a case study and rules of the group supporting the study forbid publication of case studies. Diff version: a different version of the data were published. Similar: other studies with similar findings were already published. Unimportant: the results were not important enough. Negative stats: the statistical analysis was not positive. Plan to submit: plan to submit for publication."
