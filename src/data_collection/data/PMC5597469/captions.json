  "figure_2": "Estimates of the cumulative probability of returning to HIV care after a true gap in care (time zero) according to whether there was a successful outreach (SOR) effort within 8 days from the date that a patient was flagged as lost to clinic (LTC), which was the beginning of the gap in care.
