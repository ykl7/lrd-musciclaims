PMC5597469,"This is supported by the extremely narrow intervals around the cumulative incidence estimates (Figure 2; see grey areas around the curves) which imply that, under widely differing assumptions about the true rate of out-of-care mortality, our observations outlined in the previous section (which did not consider the unknown mortality after a gap in care) were quite robust to potential under-ascertainment of mortality as a competing risk for re-engagement in care with the adjusted hazard ratios falling in the range of 1.96 to 2.03 between successful outreach and no outreach (analyses not shown).",PMC5597469_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Estimates of the cumulative probability of returning to HIV care after a true gap in care (time zero) according to whether there was a successful outreach (SOR) effort within 8 days from the date that a patient was flagged as lost to clinic (LTC), which was the beginning of the gap in care. Estimates are based on the analysis of the observed data (black solid and dashed lines) and the sensitivity analysis regarding various scenarios of the unobserved out-of-care mortality (shaded areas corresponding to a range of mortality rates while out of care).",./data/PMC5597469/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/eed0/5597469/4d650c1e7e60/nihms881998f2.jpg
