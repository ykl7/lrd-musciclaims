PMC7799493,"Since the plateau region is longer for vegetation with LAD 0.75 (Figure 4c, Cases 10 and 11), adding a fence is advantageous because it results in enhanced reduction for a substantial distance behind the barrier.",PMC7799493_figure_4,Figure 4:,"Contours at 3 ms−1 for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only LAD 0.75 (Case 7), vegetation only LAD 1.5 (Case 8), fence only far from highway (Case 3), vegetation LAD 0.75 followed by 3m fence (Case 10), and vegetation LAD 1.5 followed by 3m fence (case 11) (a) Velocity; (b) TKE; (c) Normalized concentration. The concentration has been normalized by the maximum concentration for the no barrier (Case 1). The contours highlight a region of 120 m behind the barrier as demonstrated by the scale above them.
