  "figure_1": "Schematic of the design scenarios that were evaluated in this study. All the designs tested were located approximately 1 m away from the paved outer highway shoulder, except for the fence only far from freeway design (Cases 3 and 4) which was located 12 m further away.",
  "figure_2": "a) Top view of the domain; b) Side view of the domain; c) The plane over which the downwind concentration was evaluated which started right after the barrier at distance 0 m and extended for a 100 m downwind.",
  "figure_3": "Results from the LES model used in our study versus field measurement and LES results from Pan et al. (2014) (a) Normalized height versus normalized mean velocity; (b) Normalized height versus normalized Reynolds Stress.",
  "figure_4": "Contours at 3 ms−1 for the no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only LAD 0.75 (Case 7), vegetation only LAD 1.5 (Case 8), fence only far from highway (Case 3), vegetation LAD 0.75 followed by 3m fence (Case 10), and vegetation LAD 1.5 followed by 3m fence (case 11) (a) Velocity; (b) TKE; (c) Normalized concentration. The concentration has been normalized by the maximum concentration for the no barrier (Case 1). The contours highlight a region of 120 m behind the barrier as demonstrated by the scale above them. The dotted black lines highlight the concentration plateau region for the vegetation only cases where there is slow pollutant dispersion due to reduced velocity and TKE.",
  "figure_5": "Normalized concentration versus distance from the barrier for no barrier (Case 1), vegetation only (Case 8), and vegetation followed by 3m fence (Case 11) for (a) particle size 15 nm; (b) particle size 253 nm. The dashed black line on Figure 4a highlights the plateau region behind the barrier for the vegetation only (Case 8) where there is reduced pollutant dispersion. The dotted lines show the pollutant reduction value at 30 m and 70 m of the Vegetation only (Case 8) case compared to the No barrier (Case 1). Pollutant reduction depends on the particle size and location behind the barrier.",

  "figure_8": "Normalized concentration versus distance from the barrier for no barrier (Case 2), vegetation only (Case 9), and vegetation followed by 3m fence (Case 12) for (a) particle size 15 nm; (b) particle size 253 nm; Particle size distribution at a distance of 15 m from the barrier for the no barrier, vegetation only and vegetation followed by 3m fence normalized by the no barrier concentration at 15 m c) Wind speed 3 ms−1 (Cases 1, 8, and 11) ( d) Wind speed 1 ms−1 (Cases 2, 9, and 12)",
  "figure_9": "Normalized concentration contours for a) Fence only, far from highway (Case 3) b) Fence only, close to highway (Case 5), c) Vegetation followed by fence (Case 11), and d) Fence followed by vegetation (Case 15). Placing the fence close to the highway and adding vegetation to a fence increase pollutant dispersion."
