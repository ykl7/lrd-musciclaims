PMC9898462,"The interaction between age and the biomarker on autocorrect errors was not significant in a model with all target words (b = .07; SE = .07; χ2 =1.05. p = .307), not significant in a model with only dominant function word targets (b = .02; SE = .07; χ2 < 1), and also not significant when using total Tau or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio instead of the Tau/Aβ42 ratio (ps ≥ .31).Diagnostic utility of autocorrect errors

PMC9898462,"While AD risk was associated with increased likelihood of autocorrection errors, it is unlikely that this is a consequence of diminished semantic processing since function word targets elicited more autocorrect errors than content word targets (see Figure 1), and function words better discriminated biomarker positive from negative individuals than content words (see Figure 2).",PMC9898462_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves classifying biomarker status (Tau/AB42 threshold) for 64 cognitively normal participants based on A) function errors, B) content errors, and C) selected neuropsychological tests
