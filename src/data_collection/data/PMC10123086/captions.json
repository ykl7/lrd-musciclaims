  "figure_1": "In the 1980s, the cognitive and neural sciences were populated with linear stage-based “box-and-arrow” models of cognition. Cavanagh (1987) framed visual perception as a feedforward process of encapsulated visual feature modules sending their outputs to an integration process (A). Forster (1979) described language comprehension as a feedforward sequence of modules that did not allow feedback signals (B).",
  "figure_2": "In the 1990s, the cognitive and neural sciences began reporting a wide variety of context effects suggesting that the subsystems in Figure 1 are not as modular as once thought. Essentially, feedback and crosstalk arrows were added to the traditional box-and-arrow models to accommodate those findings, converting the framework into something befitting an interactive network. As a result, visual perception is now generally seen as a highly interactive process (Vinson et al., 2016) and so is language processing (Onnis & Spivey, 2012).",
  "figure_5": "With numerous effects of visual context on real-time language processing (Spivey, 2007), the schematic box-and-arrow models in Figure 2 might need to be enhanced with yet another arrow, connecting the visual system to the language system.",
  "figure_6": "With numerous effects of linguistic context on real-time visual processing (Spivey, 2007), the schematic box-and-arrow model in Figure 5 might need to update the arrow connecting the visual system and the language system to be bi-directional.",
  "figure_7": "In place of a box-and-arrow diagram, this “arrows-and-arrows” diagram may better depict the flexibility with which various cognitive processes can not only interact with each other but also reshape themselves.",
  "figure_8": "The cognitive system can temporarily reshape itself, via soft-assembly, to emphasize certain interactions (bold arrows) and de-emphasize others (dashed arrows). This schematic depiction of a soft-assembly might be for a cognitive system that is engaged in catching an American football while leaping in the air (or perhaps catching a bar of soap that’s trying to escape in the shower).",
  "figure_9": "The cognitive system can temporarily reshape itself, via soft-assembly, to emphasize certain interactions (bold arrows) and de-emphasize others (dashed arrows). This schematic depiction of a soft-assembly might be for a cognitive system that is engaged in silently reading a journal article.",
  "figure_10": "These three slightly different theoretical frameworks operating at the cutting edge of contemporary cognitive science all can be seen as interactive frameworks that combine many contextual factors at once to convert sensory input into mental states and/or actions. (A) Bayesian approaches emphasize static internal mental representations that have probabilities associated with them. (B) Dynamical systems approaches emphasize temporally dynamic trajectories on a state-space manifold that may include both neural and non-neural parameters. (C) Neural network approaches emphasize roughly neurally plausible simulations of the relationships between sensory input, cognitive processes, and motor output.",
  "figure_11": "An abstract depiction of the relationship between higher-level, mid-level, and lower-level theoretical frameworks. In this perspective, different levels are allowed to have their own idiosyncratic theoretical constructs (i.e., shapes), however, it is crucial that they connect with adjacent levels at least enough to confirm some degree of compatibility between those constructs."
