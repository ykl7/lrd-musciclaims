With submission of a Data Descriptor, authors provide a secure link to dataset(s) stored in an external repository. Editors and referees are granted access to the data, in a manner that does reveal their identities to the authors. Upon publication, both the article and the datasets are made freely accessible online under appropriate terms or licences",./data/PMC5793987/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a672/5793987/11a1d2f76f37/41073_2016_15_Fig1_HTML.jpg

For Data Descriptors describing a clinical restricted-access dataset, authors provide with their submission a description of where the dataset(s) are hosted and a copy of the DUA. A process is then agreed between the journal and the authors, by which referees and editors may request access to the data during peer review. Upon publication, the article is made openly available, and the host data repository releases a landing page for the clinical dataset(s). Users may request access to the data according to the process and terms outlined in the Data Descriptor and associated DUA",./data/PMC5793987/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a672/5793987/bcd50be0abcc/41073_2016_15_Fig2_HTML.jpg
