Open in a new tabTrapping sites from 2016 to 2018, and the relation to city limits, are depicted in the form of a dot density map, as shown in Figure 2.",PMC8400484_figure_2,Figure 2.,Trap sites are indicated by blue dots on the map. Locations are shown county wide which include city and rural areas. A total of 475 sites were utilized over the collection period.,./data/PMC8400484/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9f36/8400484/b4654fa0bd68/pathogens-10-01022-g002.jpg
