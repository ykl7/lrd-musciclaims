The size of dot indicates the quantity of mosquito. Cities with striped, orange overlay indicate limited data collected or no dominant species identified due to equal presence of multiple mosquito species.",
  "figure_5": "Mosquito counts per MMWR week are shown in relation to temperature °F and humidity levels. Mosquitoes are represented by an open circle, humidity by a red × and temperature by a green v. Scatter plot results depict an increase in mosquitoes as temperature and humidity increased. Results also illustrate mosquito activity at cooler temperatures but not lower than 40 °F."
