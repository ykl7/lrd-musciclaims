Considering the existing distribution of human resources, infrastructure, and planned patient load at each level of care, we propose a new model of Integrated care framework called the “Indian Model of Integrated Healthcare (IMIH).” The model has been planned at three levels of integration: Macro, Meso, and Micro levels Integration using the existing HDS as follows:


AMacro level of integration:
The Macro Level of Integration will help in load-balancing by diverting patients in a coordinated manner through a gateway between 3 tiers of HDS using the Central Gateway Control Room (CGCR) within the states, which can be scaled up in later stages, to include the apex centres (Fig. 1).",PMC10777560_figure_1,Fig. 1.,Proposed IMIH framework,./data/PMC10777560/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/41de/10777560/53c155ed087e/12913_2023_10454_Fig1_HTML.jpg
