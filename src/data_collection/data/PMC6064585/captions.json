  "figure_2": "HbA1c levels at lead-in baseline and the end of the lead-in period. Efficacy end points were assessed at week − 2 before randomization (treatment duration 14 weeks). Data are mean with SD shown as error bars. Mean change from baseline (95% CI) is shown above the bars. n is the number of patients with baseline and week − 2 results.
