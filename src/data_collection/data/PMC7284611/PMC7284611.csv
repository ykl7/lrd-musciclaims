GRL—group of land use types (for codes, see Material and Methods); 1 Means within a column followed by the same letter are not significantly different at p ≤ 0.05, as tested by one-way ANOVA, followed by Fisher LSD post-hoc test. ** The last row represents the results of one-way ANOVA.When considering the separate land use types, the maximum total of 85 plant species were recorded in the scoring plots along the small to medium-sized streams and rivers (code E32), 69 species were found in the wheat fields (code A11), and 65 in the pastures (code C22); however, there were many more scoring plots in wheat, and therefore, the mean number of species per scoring plot was lower in comparison with the other two types (Table 2, Figure 1).",PMC7284611_figure_1,Figure 1.,Plant diversity in the regions of study.
