For each dataset submitted, completion of a Site and Biota template is mandatory (solid arrows) and completion of an Environment template is optional (broken arrows). A dataset must comprise general metadata (e.g., dataset name, data contributor; Table 1) and data collected on sites, biota, and optionally on habitat (environmental data). The Site template is used to insert the site data, including spatial (geo‐locational) data and other metadata about the sampling locations, for example, river names and flow regimes (Table 1). The Biota template is used to insert the biotic sample data (taxonomical inventories of biota) along with metadata on the associated sampling methods and flow status of sites at the time of sampling (Table 1). The Environment template is used to insert the environment sample data (physical and chemical measures) along with metadata on the associated sampling methods and flow status of sites at the time of sampling (Table 1). The general metadata are entered uniformly across each Site, Biota, and Environment templates that encapsulate a unique dataset. IRBAS logo © IRBAS",

Step 2 involves a quality control and assurance parsing process to ensure data are inserted correctly, completely, and in accordance with the standardization requirements of the database, and the checking of taxonomic nomenclature in the Biota file against the IRBAS taxonomic library (Figure 4). Registered users can explore the database via the interface by zooming in on locations with data presented on a map of the world (Step 3a) and make requests to download data (Step 3b) using a simple check‐box selection procedure that sends specific queries via the interface to the database.
