Steps 1 and 2 result in the contribution of a dataset to the IRBAS database (see Figure 1), which requires users to register, fill in templates with data (solid arrows indicate mandatory templates and broken arrows optional templates), save these as.csv files, and then insert them into the IRBAS database via the IRBAS interface. Step 2 involves a quality control and assurance parsing process to ensure data are inserted correctly, completely, and in accordance with the standardization requirements of the database, and the checking of taxonomic nomenclature in the Biota file against the IRBAS taxonomic library (Figure 4). Registered users can explore the database via the interface by zooming in on locations with data presented on a map of the world (Step 3a) and make requests to download data (Step 3b) using a simple check‐box selection procedure that sends specific queries via the interface to the database.
