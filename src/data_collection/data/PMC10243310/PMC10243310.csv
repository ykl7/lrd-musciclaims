PMC10243310,"For alcohol equivalences, participants included in analyses indicated that, on average, $50 was equally attractive to 27.73 standard drinks (SD = 24.07; range = 3–120) and $200 was equally attractive to 111.81 standard drinks (SD = 103.78; range = 7–500).Analysis of Variance
The omnibus ANOVA comparing rates of DD across single-commodity and cross-commodity DD tasks for the $50 magnitude was significant, F(3,276) = 43.79, p < .001, see Figure 1).",PMC10243310_figure_1,Figure 1.
