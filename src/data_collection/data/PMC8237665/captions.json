  "figure_01": "An overview of the seven sites across four distinct geological settings that were sampled in this study. All scale bars are ∼25 cm; additional geographical and ground cover context is provided for each site in SI Appendix, Figs. S1–S5.",
  "figure_02": "Quantity of methane oxidized during extended laboratory-based incubation experiments. Please note the 10× shift in the y-axis scale marked by the scale break and dotted line at 50,000 nmol/cm3. Below this line, all data below 50,000 nmol/cm3 are shown with axis increments of 10,000 nmol/cm3; above this line, all data above 50,000 nmol/cm3 are shown with axis increments of 100,000 nmol/cm3. Error bars represent propagated errors from both the D/H: 14C scaling factor and, where sufficient material was available for triplicate experiments (Dataset S1), incubation SDs. Values from site-specific autoclaved control incubations were subtracted from each data point.",
  "figure_03": "Confocal microscopy images of an intact interior portion of sample PD R1. (Top) Rock surface. (Bottom) Fluorescence signal from hybridized Arch 915 and DSS 658 FISH probes. A range of cell–cell and cell–rock arrangements were observed, including A) mixed archaeal–SRB aggregates, B) “shell-type” aggregates in which archaeal members occupy exterior spaces and SRB members comprise the interior, and C) domain-specific communities lining rock pore spaces.",
  "figure_04": "Relative abundance heat map of the thirty-two 16S rRNA gene exact sequence variants (ESVs) that account for at least 5% of the relative abundance in at least one sample. Each row represents a distinct ESV, while columns correspond to the 22 rock or sediment samples (all are labeled at the bottom of the figure). Taxonomic groupings of the 32 ESVs and their closest hits via Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (or BLAST) are indicated on the left, and ESV labels are to the right, colored by putative metabolic category. Bars above the heat map indicate Faith’s phylogenetic diversity index (a measure of alpha diversity) and the AOM rate (on a log10 scale)."
