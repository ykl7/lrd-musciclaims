PMC8714737,"Despite the apparent equivalence between options, participants preferred to take the final turn rather than the two turns that were available earlier (see Figure 1 for abstraction of maze).",PMC8714737_figure_1,Figure 1.,"(Left) Overhead view of the fish tank during a test trial. There were three possible turn options, all of equivalent length. During familiarization, the middle two walls, which create the turns, were not present.
