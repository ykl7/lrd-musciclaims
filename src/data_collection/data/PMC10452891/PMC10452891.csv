PMC10452891,"Given the above discussion, it can be suggested that MP stress-induced reduction in photosynthesis (

) results from six complementary mechanisms: (i) higher ROS production, leading to oxidative stress, (ii) structural damage and modification of membrane proteins in PSII, (iii) conversion of chlorophyll to phytol and plausibly higher activity of chlorophyllase enzyme due to higher ROS production, (iv) peroxidation of the chloroplast and thylakoid membrane, (v) alteration in leaf ionome, and (vi) alteration in gene expression relating to the photosynthesis system.",PMC10452891_figure_2,Figure 2.,"(A) Entry of microplastic particle via cracks on newly developed roots, (B) effects of microplastics (MPs) on photosynthesis, where QA-receptors (QA), photosystem II (PSII), photosystem I (PSI) plastocyanin (PC), cytochrome b6f complex (Ctybf), Ferredoxin‐NADP+ reductase (FNR), ferredoxin (Fd), (C) ROS production in chloroplast under MPs stress.",./data/PMC10452891/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/892d/10452891/d4196dc33313/fpls-14-1226484-g002.jpg

Upon the entry of MP particles in roots via aquaporins or non-selective cation channels (NSCC), MPs may induce membrane depolarization and increase ROS production in the cytosol. Both membrane depolarization and excessive ROS production in the cytosol cause the activation of depolarization activated- and ROS activated- cation efflux channels, for instance, gated outwardly rectifying K+ channel (GORK) and NSCC for K+, Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (Nramps) channels for Fe2+ and Zinc transporter 1 (ZnT1) for Zn2+ at the plasma membrane, thereby decreasing the concentration of cations in the cytosol.
