Upon the entry of MP particles in roots via aquaporins or non-selective cation channels (NSCC), MPs may induce membrane depolarization and increase ROS production in the cytosol. Both membrane depolarization and excessive ROS production in the cytosol cause the activation of depolarization activated- and ROS activated- cation efflux channels, for instance, gated outwardly rectifying K+ channel (GORK) and NSCC for K+, Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (Nramps) channels for Fe2+ and Zinc transporter 1 (ZnT1) for Zn2+ at the plasma membrane, thereby decreasing the concentration of cations in the cytosol.
