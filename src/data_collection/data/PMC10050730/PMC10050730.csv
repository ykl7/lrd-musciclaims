PMC10050730,"Special challenges for formulation of metrics for staffing of maternity and newborn services.


–The need for health facilities to be able to assure 24-h cover, as large elements of maternity clinical presentations and care needs are unpredictable.


–Many life-threatening complications around the time of childbirth occur infrequently, so maintaining staff competence and confidence in dealing with them requires special planning, especially in facilities with a low annual number of births.


–To avoid ‘too much too soon, too little too late’ (2) in the provision of care, a high level of team capacity is needed, with competencies to identify and manage complications while having confidence to avoid unnecessary medicalization of uncomplicated labour, delivery and newborn care.


–As well as technical competence in the provision of care, maternity and newborn services need to be able to give consistent attention to the experience of care for women, their partners and families, in line with the Hulton and WHO frameworks for quality care (Figure 1) (3, 4).",PMC10050730_figure_1,Figure 1.,Reprinted from Tunçalp et al. 2015 (4) with permission.,./data/PMC10050730/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1c93/10050730/48d506d52897/fgwh-04-1028273-g001.jpg
