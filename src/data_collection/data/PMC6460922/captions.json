A terminology server is used to expand, transform and standardize concepts used in metadata descriptions and in user queries. The user is only responsible for submitting a query in natural language to the DataMed search engine, such as “astrocytoma and IDH1.” (The figure uses illustrations from PresenterMedia.com.)",
  "figure_2": "Community input to the Data Discovery Index Consortium. Working groups involved over 86 people from multiple institutions to scope the project via use cases, develop core metadata specifications, recommend identifier strategies, develop and test the search engine prototype, and discuss issues in data citation. Additionally, bioCADDIE funded external pilot projects for development of software that will be incorporated into the DataMed prototype."
