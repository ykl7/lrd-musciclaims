  "figure_2": "Forest plot of estimated directional effects of health, cognitive function and engagement with life on perceived age-related losses (left panel, filled circles) and gains (right panel, filled circles). Estimates for these effects from a controlled model (i.e. that allows for potential reverse causation) are displayed as open circles in each second line."
