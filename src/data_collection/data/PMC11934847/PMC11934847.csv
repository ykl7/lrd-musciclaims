PMC11934847,We display these regions of significance in Figure 1.,PMC11934847_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,Regression of Affect Ratings on Resilience for Nostalgia and Control Conditions. Vertical dashed lines indicate Johnson–Neyman region of significance borders. Scatter shows distribution of participant scores in nostalgia (red) and control (blue) conditions.,./data/PMC11934847/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3d65/11934847/ec097f2fd761/BJSO-64-0-g002.jpg
PMC11934847,The J–N regions of significance displayed in Figure 1 show that nostalgia increased activated PA at resilience values higher than 5.58 (+0.57 SD) and decreased it at resilience values lower than 2.50 (−2.22 SD).,PMC11934847_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,Regression of Affect Ratings on Resilience for Nostalgia and Control Conditions.
