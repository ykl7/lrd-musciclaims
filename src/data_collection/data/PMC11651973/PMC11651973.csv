Multifidus cross-sectional area and fat fraction were determined using custom MatLab code to differentiate between muscle and fat. Regions of interest were drawn around the right and left multifidus in T2-weighted axial MRIs of the lumbar spine (A). Right and left multifidus were evaluated for muscle size (B), then, a bi-gaussian distribution of voxel intensity (C) was used to determine the intercept (red circle) between water (blue line) and fat (green line). The intercept is used as a threshold; greater voxel intensities are designated as fat and lower voxel intensities are designated as muscle. This analysis highlights muscle as teal and fat as yellow (D) and provides a calculation for both right and left multifidus cross-sectional area and fat fraction (D, table).
