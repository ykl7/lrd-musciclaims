  "figure_5": "Illustration on the Dixon method. (A) A multi-echo acquisition illustrated in the case of 6 echoes Dixon sequence at 3T (Canon Medical System, Fat Iron Quantification). Signal intensity decay is sampled at several time points corresponding to partially in-phase and opposed-phase spin states as shown in image numbers 1−6 acquired at a starting time of 1.2 ms and an ending time of 6.2 ms. (B) Native multi-echo Dixon images in the case of 6-echo Dixon sequence (Canon Medical System, Fat Iron Quantification): IP, OP, fat, water, PDFF, iron (R2*). These images were constructed a posteriori using the multi-echo images (A) and thanks to dedicated algorithms dealing with field inhomogeneity corrections, fat/water signal contribution separation, and specific image reconstruction for each one.

  "figure_6": "MRI image processing. Multifidus cross-sectional area and fat fraction were determined using custom MatLab code to differentiate between muscle and fat. Regions of interest were drawn around the right and left multifidus in T2-weighted axial MRIs of the lumbar spine (A). Right and left multifidus were evaluated for muscle size (B), then, a bi-gaussian distribution of voxel intensity (C) was used to determine the intercept (red circle) between water (blue line) and fat (green line). The intercept is used as a threshold; greater voxel intensities are designated as fat and lower voxel intensities are designated as muscle. This analysis highlights muscle as teal and fat as yellow (D) and provides a calculation for both right and left multifidus cross-sectional area and fat fraction (D, table).
