PMC6593373,"Representative thermal inactivation curves of Salmonella that incubated for 24 hr in TSBYE with pH 6.0, 7.4, and 9.0 at four temperatures (15, 25, 35, and 45°C) and subsequentially subjected to thermal treatments at 55°C are shown in Figure 1a–d.",PMC6593373_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Representative thermal inactivation curves of Salmonella that incubated for 24 hr in TSBYE with pH 6.0 (black circles), 7.4 (white triangles with dashed line), and 9.0 (white circles) at four temperatures (a: 15, b: 25, c: 35, and d: 45°C) and subsequentially subjected to thermal treatments at 55°C.

PMC6593373,"For the bacteria incubated at 25°C and subjected to thermal treatment at 55°C (Figure 1b), the gradient of thermal inactivation was significantly (p < 0.05) higher at pH 9.0 (−0.1162) than that at pH 6.0 (−0.0858) and pH 7.4 (−0.0862).",PMC6593373_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Representative thermal inactivation curves of Salmonella that incubated for 24 hr in TSBYE with pH 6.0 (black circles), 7.4 (white triangles with dashed line), and 9.0 (white circles) at four temperatures (a: 15, b: 25, c: 35, and d: 45°C) and subsequentially subjected to thermal treatments at 55°C.
