  "figure_1": "Representative thermal inactivation curves of Salmonella that incubated for 24 hr in TSBYE with pH 6.0 (black circles), 7.4 (white triangles with dashed line), and 9.0 (white circles) at four temperatures (a: 15, b: 25, c: 35, and d: 45°C) and subsequentially subjected to thermal treatments at 55°C. Thermal inactivation gradients are shown in trend line equations in each figure"
