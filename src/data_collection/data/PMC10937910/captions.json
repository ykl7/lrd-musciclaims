  "figure_1": "The chart above describes the procedure and offensive processes of the pattern anticipation task. The 11 video segments (six for counter attacks and five for positional attacks) were randomly presented to each participant. After a one-second pause, the video segments were displayed for approximately 8–12 s. Then, the video was stopped and a blank response image was shown. Participants were instructed to use a mouse to indicate future locations (approximately 1–2 s in the future, depending on whether players in the video completed their current action). Finally, the future location of the soccer ball and all offensive and defensive players were marked on the blank response image. The task took about 30 min on average for each participant."
