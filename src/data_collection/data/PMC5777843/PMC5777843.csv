PMC5777843,We created a two-session journal club to connect undergraduate students to experimental design principles through reading primary literature (Figure 1).,PMC5777843_figure_1,Figure 1.,Flowchart of targeted journal club activities.,./data/PMC5777843/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e996/5777843/fa5f7e6804cd/june-16-83f1.jpg
PMC5777843,"Our screencast focused on using control experiments to isolate a specific variable and exclude alternative explanations, addressing the question “how can we know that observation ‘A’ is due to factor ‘B’ and not factor ‘C’?” (Figure 2A).",PMC5777843_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Diagrams of experimental design theory, sample experimental design flowchart, and corresponding projected data.
(A) Relationships of outcome and experimental variables to consider in designing experiments
(B) Diagram of possible relationships options for three factors testing gene expression regulation; corresponding experiments and appropriate controls are based on this logic
(C) Screencast slides conveying data of gene being directly regulated in cell culture by a specific steroid receptor based on four experimental results; in this example, gene “A” is regulated by steroid treatment (yellow bar) compared to vehicle treatment (light blue bar), regulated by the receptor-selective agonist (orange bar), not regulated by co-treatment of steroid with an antagonist (teal bar), and regulated by steroid treatment in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor (green bar).",./data/PMC5777843/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e996/5777843/ab31106d9204/june-16-83f2.jpg
PMC5777843,"We discussed appropriate control experiments for three experimental variables/questions (Treatment = does steroid treatment regulate a gene’s mRNA level?; Receptor = which of two steroid receptors mediates the observed mRNA change?; Direct/Indirect = is the mRNA change a direct effect of the steroid receptor on the gene or an indirect effect through regulating the mRNA of another protein?) and how corresponding results would be added to a figure (Figure 2B, 2C).",PMC5777843_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Diagrams of experimental design theory, sample experimental design flowchart, and corresponding projected data.
