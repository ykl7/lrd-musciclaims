  "figure_1": "Semantic units introduce additional layers atop the RDF/OWL layer of triples within a knowledge graph. The figure illustrates a partitioning of the triple layer into statement units, wherein each triple aligns with exactly one statement unit, and each statement unit contains one or more triples. Statement units can be organized into diverse types of semantically meaningful collections, denoted as compound units. Compound units serve as the basis for defining several layers that contribute to the enhanced structuring and organization of the knowledge graph in semantically meaningful ways",
  "figure_2": "Comparison of a human-readable statement with its machine-actionable representation as a semantic graph following the RDF syntax. Top: A human-readable statement concerning the observation that a specific apple (X) weighs 204.56 grams. Bottom: The corresponding representation of the same statement as a semantic graph, adhering to RDF syntax and following the established pattern for measurement data from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) [35] of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO)",
  "figure_3": "Alternative machine-actionable representation of the data statement from Fig. 2. This graph represents the same data statement as shown in Fig. 2 Top, but applies a semantic graph model that is based on the Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) [36], an ontology frequently used in the ecology community",
  "figure_4": "A detailed machine-actionable representation of the metadata relating to a weight measurement datum. This detailed illustration presents a machine-actionable representation of a mass measurement process employing a balance. It documents metadata associated with a weight measurement datum, articulated as an RDF graph. The graph establishes connections between an instance of mass measurement assay (OBI:0000445) and instances of various other classes from diverse ontologies. Noteworthy details include the identification of the measurement conductor, the location and timing of the measurement, the protocol followed, and the specific device utilized (i.e., a balance). Additionally, the graph outlines the material entity serving as the subject and input for the measurement process (i.e., ‘apple X’), along with specifying the resultant data encapsulated in a particular weight measurement assertion",
  "figure_6": "Example of a statement unit. The illustration displays a statement unit exemplifying a has-weight relation. The data graph, denoted within the blue box at the bottom, articulates the statement with ‘apple X’ as the subject and ‘gram X’ alongside the numerical value 204.56 as the objects. The peach-colored box encompasses the semantic-units graph, housing triples that encapsulate the semantic unit’s representation. It explicitly denotes the resource embodying the statement unit (bordered blue box), an instance of the *SEMUNIT:weight statement unit* class, with ‘apple X’ identified as the subject. Notably, the UPRI of *’weight statement unit’* is also the UPRI of the semantic unit’s data graph (the unbordered subgraph in the blue box)",

  "figure_7": "Examples for two different types of identification units. A\nNamed-individual identification unit. The data graph within the unbordered box delineates the class-affiliation of the ‘apple X’ (NCIT:C71985) instance. The subject, ‘apple X’, is connected to its class through the property type (RDF:type), while its label ‘apple X’ is conveyed via the property  label (RDFS:label). The unbordered blue box designates the data graph associated with this named-individual identification unit. B\nClass identification unit. This data graph of this unit, represented by the unbordered blue box, captures the label and identifier of the class ‘apple’ (NCIT:C71985), the unit’s designated subject. Optionally, it includes the URI details of the ontology and the ontology version from which the class is derived. The bordered blue box designates the resource of this class identification unit",
  "figure_8": "Example of a compound unit, denoted as *‘apple X item unit’*, that encompasses multiple statement units. Compound units, by virtue of merging the data graphs of their associated statement units, indirectly manifest a data graph (here, highlighted by the blue arrow). Notably, the compound unit possesses a semantic-units graph (depicted in the peach-colored box) delineating the associated semantic units",
  "figure_9": "Typed statement unit with dynamic label and dynamic mind-map pattern. A\nTyped statement unit exemplified for a weight statement. This typed statement unit consolidates the data graphs of six statement units, including the *’weight statement unit’* from Figure 6, serving as the reference statement unit for this *‘typed statement unit’*, and five instances of *SEMUNIT:named-individual identification unit*. B\nDynamic label: Illustrated is an example of the dynamic label associated with the reference statement unit class (*SEMUNIT:weight statement unit*). This dynamic label template is utilized for textual displays of information from the reference statement unit. C\nDynamic mind-map pattern: Depicted is an example of the dynamic mind-map pattern associated with the reference statement unit class (*SEMUNIT:weight statement unit*). This pattern template is employed for graphical displays of information from the reference statement unit",
  "figure_12": "Detail from the RDF graph illustrating the contents of a scholarly publication. The data schema employed aligns with the schema shown in Figure 11, tailored to accommodate semantic units. The publication’s content is encapsulated within a dedicated publication item group unit instance through various interconnected semantic units. The publication itself is denoted as an instance of journal article (IAO:0000013). The publication item group unit encompasses multiple item units related to the research activity, interconnected through the *SEMUNIT:hasLinkedSemanticUnit* property. The interconnected hierarchy extends to an investigation (OBI:0000066) instance, resulting in a data set (IAO:0000100) instance with a description (SIO:000136) instance as its part. This description, in turn, has the multicellular organism item unit describing the organism as its part, which has an instance of multicellular organism (UBERON:0000468) as its subject. The blue arrow signifies the representation of the data graph (dark blue box with shadow) by this specific item unit (bordered box in the same color). The ontological layer is constituted by the data graphs of the semantic units, while their semantic-units graphs collectively form the discursive layer. Distinct context units demarcate the reference frames of the publication, research-activity, and research-subject, delineated by is-about statements. For reasons of clarity of presentation, the associated statement units are not shown in the discursive layer",
  "figure_10": "Five levels of representational granularity. The integration of semantic units into a knowledge graph introduces a semantic-units graph layer, enriching the existing data graph layer. This augmentation includes distinct levels, namely triples, statement units, item units, and item group units, providing a nuanced hierarchy of representational granularity within a knowledge graph",
  "figure_11": "A semantic schema for modelling the contents of scholarly publications. The depicted semantic schema outlines the modelling structure for encapsulating the components of scholarly publications. It delineates the relationship between a research activity, its associated input and output, and the underlying specification of its process plan, manifested in the form of a research method and research objective. The model draws inspiration from [61]",
