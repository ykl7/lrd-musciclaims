PMC11774762,"Specifically, this review will address the following critical questions: (1) What are the crucial sociodemographic and psychological profiles of cyberbullying victims? (2) What critical contextual and environmental factors are associated with cyberbullying victimization? (3) What are the key psychological and behavioural consequences of cyberbullying for victims? (4) How effective are existing interventions in mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying? By summarizing the associations reported in meta-analyses, this review aims to provide a clearer picture regarding the phenomena of cyberbullying victimization.Results
