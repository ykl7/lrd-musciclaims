Ventromedial PFC is both associated with heart rate variability (HRV) A (Thayer et al., 2012), and was the only brain region identified in a meta-analysis of nearly 400 neuroimaging studies as showing more activity during positive than negative affect. B (Lindquist et al., 2016). In our recent randomized clinical trial, we found that an mPFC ROI C (Nashiro et al., 2022) with coordinates based on (A) increased in its functional connectivity with the left amygdala at rest across a 5-week HRV-biofeedback intervention condition compared with an active control condition",
