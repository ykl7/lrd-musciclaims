  "figure_5": "The topmost reported HLA alleles associated with diseases: All the HLA alleles indicated have been grouped to their second digit and represented in the pie chart. HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 are the most studied amongst the HLA genes",
  "figure_6": "Diseases/conditions associated with HLA genes: Graph represents three level hierarchy of diseases. Each colour represents a level. There are 24 major categories as represented in green colour, which is further divided into subcategories. Each disease name is matched to its Mesh id and a normalised mesh keyword. Autoimmune, Neoplasms and Joint disease are the top most associated diseases. As anticipated, significant numbers of studies related to transplantation are also observed",

First column represents generic “HLA” studies where specific gene information is not mentioned. A large number of associations were also observed with Non-classical (HLA-E,F,G) genes",
