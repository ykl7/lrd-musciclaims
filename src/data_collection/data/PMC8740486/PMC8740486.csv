PMC8740486,Figure 6 represents a snapshot of common HLA associated diseases.,PMC8740486_figure_6,Fig. 6.,"Diseases/conditions associated with HLA genes: Graph represents three level hierarchy of diseases. Each colour represents a level. There are 24 major categories as represented in green colour, which is further divided into subcategories. Each disease name is matched to its Mesh id and a normalised mesh keyword. Autoimmune, Neoplasms and Joint disease are the top most associated diseases. As anticipated, significant numbers of studies related to transplantation are also observed",./data/PMC8740486/images/figure_6.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/24d1/8740486/93559325fe32/12864_2021_8239_Fig6_HTML.jpg
