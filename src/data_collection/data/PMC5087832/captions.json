  "figure_2": "Graph displaying the number of journal research articles obtained when querying PubMed for integrative genomics and systems genetics publications. The results are broken down by year and species. PubMed was queried on the 14/07/2016. From the results, the publication type “Journal Article” was selected (references with the publication type “Review” were discarded). When the PubMed entries for the papers matching the queries did not include information about the model organism, this was added to the entry by manual curation of the paper. In addition, the results of the queries were also manually curated in order to remove review articles incorrectly annotated in the “Journal Article” category.",
  "figure_3": "Linking genotypes to cellular-level phenotypes in the rat. (A) Many integrative genomics studies link gene expression (the transcriptome) to the genome (DNA sequence). All the examples discussed in the main text link gene expression to SNP markers, except in Guryev et al. (2008), in which gene expression is linked to CNVs. Studies linking mRNA levels to the genome in a single tissue include Monti et al. (2008), Petretto et al. (2008), Pravenec et al. (2008), Jirout et al. (2010), Low et al. (2013) and Thessen Hedreul et al. (2013), and across different tissues include Hubner et al. (2005) and Langley et al. (2013). Gene regulatory networks can also be linked to the genome (exemplified by Lindblom et al., 2014; Saba et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). (B) Metabolite levels, or the metabolome, can also be linked to the genome (exemplified by Dumas et al., 2007). (C) Epigenetic marks, including DNA-methylation levels (exemplified by Johnson et al., 2014) and histone marks (exemplified by Rintisch et al., 2014), can also be linked to the genome. (D) The ribosome profile, or translatome, can also be linked to the genome (as in Schafer et al., 2015).",
  "figure_4": "Integrative genomics and systems genetics strategies in the rat. (A) Integrative genomics studies have led to the identification of disease genes, for instance by integrating QTL data (Aitman et al., 1999; Behmoaras et al., 2008) or eQTL data (Monti et al., 2008; Petretto et al., 2008; Pravenec et al., 2008; Low et al., 2013) with analysis of gene expression in disease-relevant tissues and cell types. (B) Systems genetics studies have identified master genetic regulators of trans-eQTL networks. Left: trans-eQTL networks were associated with cellular-level traits driving whole-body phenotypes in rodents (i.e. bone homeostasis and inflammatory disease) (Kang et al., 2014). Right: trans-eQTL networks identified in the rat were conserved to humans and enriched for GWAS variants, therefore linking the networks to a whole-body disease phenotype (i.e. type 1 diabetes) (Heinig et al., 2010) (see Table 2)."
