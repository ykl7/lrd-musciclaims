(b) Mean counts for leopard, Weddell, and crabeater seals, averaged by month for each season, with error bars showing the standard deviation. Southern elephant seals are presented separately because of their much higher count values. (c) Mean counts for southern elephant seals by sex and age class, averaged by month for each season, and with standard deviation represented by dot size."
