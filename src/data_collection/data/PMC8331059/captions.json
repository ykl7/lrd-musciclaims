For conventional materials, the Guidance on Particle‐TR should be consulted to answer the first questions\n\nLegend: in green: nanospecific considerations for risk assessment; in blue: question to be answered; in white: risk assessment follows sectoral guidance.

(a) If it cannot be determined whether a nanomaterial is present in the food/feed matrix or food simulant it should be assumed that nanomaterial is present. (b) The assessment of degradation products that are still in the form of nanoparticles should continue as presented in this Guidance. See Section 7.2 and Appendix C for details on in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. If it cannot be determined whether a nanomaterial is present in simulated digestive tract conditions, it should be assumed that nanomaterial is present",
