  "figure_1": "Flow chart showing methods for determination of analytical sensitivities of C-PCR, N-PCR and Q-PCR under laboratory condition. Three (a, b, c) categories of extracted DNA were used to determine the DNA detection limits. Bacterial culture showing one OD (at 600 nm) is equivalent to 8 × 108 organisms/ml",
  "figure_2": "a Agarose gel (2 %) showing DNA detection limits of C-PCR and N-PCR by amplifying fliC-d gene for typhoid diagnosis. Lane 1 to lane 8, diluted bacterial DNA (10-fold) from 3 × 106 to 3 × 10−1copies/reaction;lane 3, 3 × 104copies/reaction (sensitivity of C-PCR); lane 7, 3 × 100copies/reaction (sensitivity of N-PCR); lane 9, positive control (S. Typhi CT18); lane 10, negative control (sterile distilled water); lane 11, 100-bp DNA ladder marker. b Determination of analytical sensitivity of Q-PCR. A standard curve was generated by plotting the threshold cycles (Ct) values on y axis and DNA copy numbers/reaction on x axis. The dashed line indicates the Ct cutoff value of ≤37 at 3 × 100 copies/reaction (sensitivity of Q-PCR)"
