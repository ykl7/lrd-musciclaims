PMC4906692,The analytical sensitivities of the three PCRs were determined following the methods shown in Fig. 1.,PMC4906692_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"Flow chart showing methods for determination of analytical sensitivities of C-PCR, N-PCR and Q-PCR under laboratory condition. Three (a, b, c) categories of extracted DNA were used to determine the DNA detection limits.
