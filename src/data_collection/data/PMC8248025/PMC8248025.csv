PMC8248025,"In the assessment of corticosteroid‐related criteria, the ranking of trials in the five IO categories in order from most to least strict was as follows: ICIs, multiple IO therapies, cancer vaccines, ACT and immune modulators (Figure 4A).",PMC8248025_figure_4,FIGURE 4.,"Intensity of restrictions on corticosteroid‐ and infection‐related criteria (A,B) and the trend in attitudes toward corticosteroid administration in IO trials (C).

PMC8248025,"The most stringent limitations regarding infection were found in ICI trials, followed by those studying multiple IO therapies, especially in terms of TB (34.6% and 17.6%) and pneumonitis/pneumonia (51.7% and 31.8%) (Figure 4B; Table S1).",PMC8248025_figure_4,FIGURE 4.,"Intensity of restrictions on corticosteroid‐ and infection‐related criteria (A,B) and the trend in attitudes toward corticosteroid administration in IO trials (C).

Only the comparisons and P‐values indicating significant differences between publication curves were displayed. The wide dotted line (D‐G) represents the time point we proposed as the timely publication for IO trials. The narrow dotted line (H‐K) indicates the legal requirement of 1 year to report trial results on ClinicalTrials.gov [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",./data/PMC8248025/images/figure_5.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6e74/8248025/a024a13783f4/IJC-149-108-g001.jpg
