On day 5, each group downloaded and reviewed a presentation by another group about the same paper (closed arrows) and provided SMART feedback to their peers via Qualtrics (curved arrows). Here, group 1 provided feedback on group 2’s presentation; group 2 provided feedback on group 3’s presentation, etc. Day 5 concluded with a class discussion of all papers",
