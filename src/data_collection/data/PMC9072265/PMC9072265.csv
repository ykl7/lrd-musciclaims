PMC9072265,The ratio per year of each medical indication is shown in the graphs in Fig. 1A for CAIs and Fig. 1B for acetazolamide.,PMC9072265_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"Citation frequency of the medical indications of hypertension, heart failure, and glaucoma in the context of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. PubMed searches were limited to titles and abstracts of articles. The additional filter “Journal Article” was applied, and the journal category was set to “MEDLINE.” The ratio per year is shown in percent. The ratio is defined as number of articles mentioning A: all CAIs and B: acetazolamide together with the medical indications of hypertension, heart failure, or glaucoma relative to the total number of articles citing CAIs and acetazolamide, respectively",./data/PMC9072265/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4c3f/9072265/e3d7c9cdce71/210_2022_2228_Fig1_HTML.jpg
