PMC7988542,"Because consistent sampling for the DJFMP beach seine survey did not begin until 1995, we were only able to assess occurrence changes of the three littoral species for the three most recent drought cycles (Fig. 2).",PMC7988542_figure_2,Fig. 2.,"Time series of California's Sacramento Valley water year index with classifications defined by the California Department of Water Resources.

PMC7988542,"To assess changes in occurrence from the initial wet period to the drought period and from the drought period to subsequent recovery wet period (Fig. 2), we used a Bayesian logistic regression model with a framework similar to that found in Bennett et al.

PMC7988542,"With the exception of Sacramento sucker, the native fish species we analyzed seemed to have low resistance to droughts but demonstrate resilience in most drought cycles (Table 2, Fig. 3).",PMC7988542_figure_3,Fig. 3.,"Resistance and resilience coefficients for each species and drought cycle. Left column shows the drought resistance coefficient while the right column shows the drought resilience coefficient. Positive resistance coefficient indicates increase in occurrence from pre‐drought to drought period. Positive resilience coefficient indicates increase in occurrence from drought period to the post‐drought (i.e., recovery) period. Lines extending from each point indicate the 95% credible intervals for each term. Black points indicate coefficients with 95% credible intervals that do not include zero.",./data/PMC7988542/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f659/7988542/df95ea41ca07/EAP-31-e02243-g001.jpg
