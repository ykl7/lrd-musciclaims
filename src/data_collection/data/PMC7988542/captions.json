  "figure_2": "Time series of California's Sacramento Valley water year index with classifications defined by the California Department of Water Resources. Colors distinguish drought and wet periods, and bottom brackets show the five drought cycles, each of which consists of a pre‐drought wet period, a drought period, and a post‐drought wet period.",
  "figure_3": "Resistance and resilience coefficients for each species and drought cycle. Left column shows the drought resistance coefficient while the right column shows the drought resilience coefficient. Positive resistance coefficient indicates increase in occurrence from pre‐drought to drought period. Positive resilience coefficient indicates increase in occurrence from drought period to the post‐drought (i.e., recovery) period. Lines extending from each point indicate the 95% credible intervals for each term. Black points indicate coefficients with 95% credible intervals that do not include zero."
