  "figure_1": "Expression of VDR and responses to 1α,25(OH)2D3 in AA and EA cell lines. A, Western immunoblot measurements of VDR levels after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment (100 nmol/L, 24 hours) or vehicle control. B, RIME analyses of VDR in the indicated cells (in quadriplicates) and significantly different proteins were identified using an edgeR workflow. Volcano plots depicting enrichment levels, compared with IgG controls, between the indicated cells in basal or 1α,25(OH)2D3-stimulated conditions (100 nmol/L, 4 hours). Significant (Padj < 0.1) differentially and uniquely enriched proteins in each cell and treatment condition were classified either as a CoA, CoR, Mixed, or TF. C, The most altered components of the VDR complex were established in RC43T compared with LNCaP, and RC43N with HPr1AR, and then the delta between these comparisons were identified and ranked.",
  "figure_2": "VDR ATAC-seq in AA and EA cell lines. A, ATAC-seq was undertaken in triplicate in HPr1AR, LNCaP, RC43N, and RC43T following 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment (100 nmol/L, 4 hours) or vehicle control. FASTQ files were QC processed, aligned to hg38 (Rsubread), sorted and duplicates removed before further processing with ATACseqQC to generate nucleosome free and mononucleosome regions. Differential enrichment of regions was measured with csaw and the significantly different regions (Padj < 0.1) were then intersected to generate the Venn diagrams of overlapping regions by a minimum of 1 bp (ChIPpeakAnno). B, Motif enrichment in NF regions was undertaken with Homer and ranked by significance to visualize in descending significance. C, Frequency of enriched motifs by TF families’ class. D, Enrichment of circadian rhythm TFs.",
  "figure_3": "VDR ChIP-seq in AA and EA cell lines. A, Basal and 1α,25(OH)2D3-stimulated (100 nmol/L, 6 hours) VDR ChIP-seq was undertaken in triplicate in HPr1AR, LNCaP, RC43N, and RC43T. FASTQ files were QC processed, aligned to hg38 (Rsubread), sorted and duplicates removed before differential enrichment of regions was measured with csaw and the significantly different regions compared with IgG controls (Padj < 0.1) were then intersected to generate the Venn diagrams of overlapping regions by a minimum of 1 bp (ChIPpeakAnno). B, Significantly differentially enriched motifs were identified by Homer and nuclear receptors are illustrated. C, Changes in motif enrichment were calculated (delta) and ranked by significance for visualization.",
  "figure_4": "1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent RNA- and small RNA-Seq in AA and EA cell lines. A and B, Basal and 1α,25(OH)2D3-stimulated (100 nmol/L, 8 hours) RNA-seq was undertaken in triplicate in HPr1AR, LNCaP, RC43N, and RC43T. FASTQ files were QC processed, aligned to hg38 (Rsubread), and processed with limma-voom and edgeR workflow to identify significant DEGs (logPV > 1 and absFC > 0.37) are illustrated on Volcano plots with top DEGs illustrated. C, GSEAs (Chemical Perturbations in GSEA) was undertaken and the terms identified and visualized where the NES was in the opposite direction are visualized in RC43N and RC43T.",
  "figure_5": "The impact of BAZ1A on expression of VDR-dependent gene networks. A, Altered BAZ1A and SMARCA5 expression in AA prostate cancer was identified in TCGA prostate cancer cohort by comparing EA and AA tumors and considering status of TMPRSS2 translocations. B, The blot used for Fig. 1A (cells treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (100 nmol/L, 24 hours) or vehicle control and total protein isolated) was stripped and reprobed with antibodies toward BAZ1A and SMARCA5. C, Unique DEGs in cells with restored expression of BAZ1A. D, BAZ1A-dependent DEGs enhanced inflammatory responses and repressed MYC networks. E, Comparable and divergent GSEA enrichment in BAZ1A-dependent DEGS in RC43N and RC43T that were different from the direction of enrichment in the parental cells."
