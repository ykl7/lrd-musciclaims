A, Altered BAZ1A and SMARCA5 expression in AA prostate cancer was identified in TCGA prostate cancer cohort by comparing EA and AA tumors and considering status of TMPRSS2 translocations. B, The blot used for Fig. 1A (cells treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (100 nmol/L, 24 hours) or vehicle control and total protein isolated) was stripped and reprobed with antibodies toward BAZ1A and SMARCA5. C, Unique DEGs in cells with restored expression of BAZ1A. D, BAZ1A-dependent DEGs enhanced inflammatory responses and repressed MYC networks. E, Comparable and divergent GSEA enrichment in BAZ1A-dependent DEGS in RC43N and RC43T that were different from the direction of enrichment in the parental cells.",./data/PMC10112383/images/figure_5.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/051e/10112383/0e5ebcdbe8b0/crc-22-0389_fig5.jpg
