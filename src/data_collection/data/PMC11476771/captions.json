Concentrations from day 1 to day 8 (linear scale) in the PK population. For the calculation of means, individual concentration values that were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ of 0.100 ng/mL) were treated as zero. IV bolus was administered after each dialysis session; dialysis occurred on days 1, 3, 5, and 8. PK, pharmacokinetic; SD, standard deviation"
