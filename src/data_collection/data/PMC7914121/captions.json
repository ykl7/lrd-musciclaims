  "figure_2": "Social media and social change in gender diversity in surgery. After publication of the cover on the magazine, The New Yorker (A), the Twitter platform was used as a vehicle to promote women surgeons (B) working in institutions across the world, reproducing the cover art and thus giving a face to the thousands of women surgeons in current surgical practice. (C) The HeForShe Twitter handle mobilizing for gender equity. (D) The initial tweet by Heather Logghe starting the #ILookLikeASurgeon hashtag that eventually went viral",
  "figure_3": "Example of a tweetorial. After the 2019 Nordic HPB meeting in Helsinki, Finland, a tweetorial was presented by the host Ville Sallinen of a summary presentation. The full tweetorial can be read at https://twitter.com/villesallinen/status/1210119626165755905. The use of social media allows non-participants to take part and engage in content, allowing for a wider distribution and input to a meeting",
  "figure_4": "Traditional and alternative metrics for measuring research output. The metrics used to evaluate the impact of social media activity are changing; in a, the traditional focus on citations and impact factor (IF; Journal Citation Reports ©Clarivate Analytics) is increasingly challenged by b alternative metrics, dubbed “altmetrics” for short (collected by various projects, including Altmetric, Plum Analytics, and ImpactStory), that collect views and mentions over a wide range of sources, including (but not limited to) peer reviews on faculty of 1000, citations on Wikipedia and in public policy documents, discussions on research blogs, mainstream media coverage, bookmarks on reference managers like Mendeley, and social networks such as Twitter.

  "figure_5": "The visual abstract. An example of a visual abstract used to post summary content of a study published in BJS (courtesy of R. G.). The tweet with the visual abstract also contains a few notes on the study and should also contain a link or shortcut to the paper itself, hence acting as a teaser to attract the reader to study the full-text version. Thus, the purpose of the visual abstract is to be simplistic in message, yet will not replace the need to read and understand the full depth of the paper",
  "figure_6": "An example of an Altmetric certificate. Some journals are now providing certificate to high Altmetric scoring papers, as shown in an example (a). The Altmetric score captures activity on social media platforms and news outlets, and gives an impression of immediate attention and global reach (b) but it is unclear to what degree this returns on citations or actual impact"
