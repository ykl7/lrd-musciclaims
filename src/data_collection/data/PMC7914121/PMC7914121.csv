PMC7914121,"Advice for promoting papers on Twitter

Annotate: give different information than just the title, explain the study
Remember to post the URL to the study and ensure no broken links
Ensure abstract is available to read
Use medical hashtags
Use images, emoticons, GIFs, or visual abstracts
Tag the research team (can be tagged on a posted photo if characters limited)
Tag key Twitter users that may be interested in the study: surgeons, patients organizations, surgical associations, policy-makers (locally or internationally)
Ask questions about the implications of the work—open-ended or use Twitter polls
Like, thank, and reply if other users RT the study or comment on the study
Follow Altmetric reports if available—will show tweets and social media posts that one may have missed otherwise
