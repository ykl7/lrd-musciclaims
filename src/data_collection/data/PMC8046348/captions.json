  "figure_1": "(A) Number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and reported deaths. Data are sourced from https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/, based on case and death data aggregated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (https://systems.jhu.edu/). Vertical lines labelled (i) and (ii) refer to the date on which the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and the date on which the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic, respectively. (B) Cumulative growth of journal articles and preprints containing COVID-19–related search terms. (C) Cumulative growth of preprints containing COVID-19–related search terms, categorised by individual preprint servers. Journal article data in (B) are based upon data extracted from Dimensions (https://www.dimensions.ai; see Methods section for further details), and preprint data in (B) and (C) are based upon data gathered by Fraser and Kramer (2020). The data underlying this figure may be found in https://github.com/preprinting-a-pandemic/pandemic_preprints and https://zenodo.org/record/4587214#.YEN22Hmnx9A. COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019; WHO, World Health Organization.",
  "figure_2": "(A) Proportion of preprints with N authors. (B) Proportion of preprints deposited by country of corresponding author (top 15 countries by total preprint volume are shown). (C) Proportions of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 corresponding authors from each of the top 15 countries shown in (B) that had previously posted a preprint (darker bar) or were posting a preprint for the first time (lighter bar). (D) Correlation between date of the first preprint originating from a country (according to the affiliation of the corresponding author) and the date of the first confirmed case from the same country for COVID-19 preprints. (E) Change in bioRxiv/medRxiv preprint posting category for COVID-19 preprint authors compared to their previous preprint (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19), for category combinations with n > = 5 authors. For all panels containing country information, labels refer to ISO 3166 character codes.

  "figure_3": "(A) Percentage of COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 preprints published in peer-reviewed journals, by preprint posting month. (B) Destination journals for COVID-19 preprints that were published within our analysis period. Shown are the top 10 journals by publication volume. (C) Distribution of the number of days between posting a preprint and subsequent journal publication for COVID-19 preprints (red), non-COVID-19 preprints posted during the same period (January to October 2020) (green), and non-COVID-19 preprints posted between January and December 2019 (grey). (D) Time from posting on bioRxiv or medRxiv to publication categorised by publisher. Shown are the top 10 publishers by publication volume. Boxplot horizontal lines denote lower quartile, median, upper quartile, with whiskers extending to 1.5*IQR. All boxplots additionally show raw data values for individual preprints with added horizontal jitter for visibility.

  "figure_4": "(A) Boxplots of abstract views, binned by preprint posting month. (B) Boxplots of PDF downloads, binned by preprint posting month. Boxplot horizontal lines denote lower quartile, median, upper quartile, with whiskers extending to 1.5*IQR. All boxplots additionally show raw data values for individual preprints with added horizontal jitter for visibility.

  "figure_5": "Panels (A)–(F) show the proportion of preprints receiving at least 1 citation or mention in a given source, with the exception of panel (B) which shows the proportion of preprints receiving at least 2 tweets (to account for the fact that each preprint is tweeted once automatically by the official bioRxiv/medRxiv Twitter accounts). The inset in each panel shows a boxplot comparing citations/mentions for all COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 preprints posted within our analysis period. Boxplot horizontal lines denote lower quartile, median, upper quartile, with whiskers extending to 1.5*IQR. All boxplots additionally show raw data values for individual preprints with added horizontal jitter for visibility. Data are plotted on a log-scale with +1 added to each count for visualisation. (G) Proportion of preprints included in reference lists of policy documents from 3 sources: the ECDC, UK POST, and WHO SB. (H) Spearman correlation matrix between indicators shown in panels (A)–(F), as well as abstract views and PDF downloads for COVID-19 preprints. (I) Spearman correlation matrix between indicators shown in panels (A)–(F), in addition to abstract views and PDF downloads for non-COVID-19 preprints.
