  "figure_1": "Patient scheme. Swimmer plot indicating timing of endocrine therapy treatment and tumor tissue sampling for each patient stratified by patient response to endocrine therapy. For each tumor sample, response to treatment defined by assessment of tumor volume change and number of biological replicates were indicated. Clinically HER2+ patients with positive IHC staining were highlighted in pink box.",
  "figure_2": "Genomic characteristics. A, The pattern, frequency, and type of genomic alterations of key breast cancer genes across patients. Samples were ordered by patient and response to endocrine therapy treatment. The type of variants detected shown in lollipop plot with labeling color indicating variants observed in sensitive tumors only (cyan), that observed in resistant tumors only (orange and boxed), and that observed in both sensitive and resistant tumors (orange) for ESR1 (N = 8 patients with 23 samples; B) and GATA3 (N = 13 patient with 31 sampels; C). D, Copy number frequency landscape plots showing copy number–altered genes in sensitive and resistant tumors respectively. For each patient, copy number values were averaged among all sensitive samples and resistant samples from that patient, resulting in 23 sensitive tumors and 21 resistant tumors. Copy number gains are plotted above the x-axis in red and copy number losses are plotted below the x-axis in green. The frequency of alterations is indicated on the y-axis from 0% to 100%.",

Red dots, Timing for tissue sampling. B, Box plots indicating median score and interquartile range of VAF of detected variants stratified by synonymous and nonsynonymous variants. C, Heatmap showing VAF of nonsynonymous variants of Pan-Cancer drivers. D, Heatmap showing gene expression of hormone receptors and key signaling pathways. E, Heatmap showing copy number landscapes of all tumors from the patient.",

A, Box plots indicating median score and interquartile range of VAF of detected variants stratified by synonymous and nonsynonymous variants. B, Heatmap showing VAF of nonsynonymous variants of Pan-Cancer drivers. C, Heatmap showing gene expression of hormone receptors and key signaling pathways. D, Heatmap showing copy number landscapes of all tumors from the patient."
