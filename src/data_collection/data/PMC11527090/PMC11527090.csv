PMC11527090,Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the architecture and functioning of the CycleGAN model.,PMC11527090_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,"The cyclical consistency of the CycleGAN. This figure visually demonstrates the 3T cycle consistency. The 7T loop is conceptually symmetric. The generators are marked as performing the mappings  and . The Real 3T image is fed to the  (top left), producing the synthetic 7T image (top middle). The  discriminator differentiates between the Real and Synthetic 7T images and strives to minimize 7T adversarial loss (bottom left). The synthetic 7T image is fed into the  generator, which produces the reconstructed 3T image. The 3T cycle consistency loss ensures the 3T image can be reconstructed from the synthetic 7T image (top right).",./data/PMC11527090/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6171/11527090/5228cce5e6e5/nihpp-2024.10.16.24315609v1-f0001.jpg

We plot single patient data overlaid on group-level whisker box plots (center, median; box, 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers, 1.5 interquartile range) and the smoothed data distribution. The median Dice for CSD, GM and WM are 83.62%, 81.42%, and 89.75%, respectively.
