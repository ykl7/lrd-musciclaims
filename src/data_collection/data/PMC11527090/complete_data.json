The  discriminator differentiates between the Real and Synthetic 7T images and strives to minimize 7T adversarial loss (bottom left). The synthetic 7T image is fed into the  generator, which produces the reconstructed 3T image. The 3T cycle consistency loss ensures the 3T image can be reconstructed from the synthetic 7T image (top right).",
