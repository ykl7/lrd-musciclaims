The generators are marked as performing the mappings  and . The Real 3T image is fed to the  (top left), producing the synthetic 7T image (top middle). The  discriminator differentiates between the Real and Synthetic 7T images and strives to minimize 7T adversarial loss (bottom left). The synthetic 7T image is fed into the  generator, which produces the reconstructed 3T image. The 3T cycle consistency loss ensures the 3T image can be reconstructed from the synthetic 7T image (top right).",

(a) Generator, Discriminator and Cycle Consistency Losses for the 3T loop, (b) Generator, Discriminator, and Cycle Consistency Losses for the 7T loop, (c) Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD), (d) Cosine Resnet Distance (CRD). The graphs illustrate the evolution of loss functions and quality metrics over training epochs. The vertical black dotted line mark epoch 167, where we halted training since we did not observe an improvement bigger than 0.1% in the 3T cycle consistency loss for five consecutive epochs.",

  "figure_4": "Group-level segmentation performance for the validation (22 subjects) data set across different tissue types—Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF), Gray Matter (GM), and White Matter (WM). We plot single patient data overlaid on group-level whisker box plots (center, median; box, 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers, 1.5 interquartile range) and the smoothed data distribution. The median Dice for CSD, GM and WM are 83.62%, 81.42%, and 89.75%, respectively. The median percentual area difference (PAD) for CSF, GM, and WM are 6.82%, 7.63%, and 4.85%, respectively."
