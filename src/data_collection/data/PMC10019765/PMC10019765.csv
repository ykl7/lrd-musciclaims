PMC10019765,One of the most important trends identified in this analysis is the association between journal IF and APCs (Figure 2).,PMC10019765_figure_2,Figure 2.,Association between impact factor and article processing charge (APC) among journals housed in various global regions.,./data/PMC10019765/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7d80/10019765/127466de47f7/formative_v7i1e44633_fig2.jpg
PMC10019765,Our analysis also revealed a strong relationship between the type of OA publication model and processing costs (Figure 1).,PMC10019765_figure_1,Figure 1.,Distribution of article processing charges (APCs) displayed separately for journals adopting full and hybrid open access publishing models.,./data/PMC10019765/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7d80/10019765/e02bb1618bb5/formative_v7i1e44633_fig1.jpg
