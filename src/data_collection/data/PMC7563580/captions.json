Learners were asked before and after each lecture their degree of comfort (1 = not confident, 5 = extremely confident) reading scientific literature utilizing the algorithm described in each lecture. The violin graph above demonstrates the individual responses (dots). The shape of each plot corresponds to the relative distribution of responses in each category, where width correlates with number of responses. The corresponding table displays the results of using Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare pre- and postlecture data."
