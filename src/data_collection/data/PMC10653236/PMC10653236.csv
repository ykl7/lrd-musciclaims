Fluorescent micrographs of indirect immunofluorescence of negative control, cerebellum cells, and calbindin in mouse neurons. A, micrograph of neurons for positive control. B, fluorescent micrograph of negative control containing only the secondary conjugated antibody. C, micrograph of neuron filaments stained in cell sample. D, micrograph of calbindin stained in cell sample. E, superimposing of Fig. 1C and 1D to show position of Purkinje cells in cerebellum sample (all images are viewed at 300X magnification using a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescence microscope; UV excitation wavelength of 670nm for Cy3 and 493nm for Alexa 488).",./data/PMC10653236/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa7b/10653236/6c8ed49d0b7b/june-20-219f1.jpg
