PMC7473657,"The middle-range theory is sufficiently broad to allow transferability or portability to similar interventions28 and that can be used to design and implement interventions within complex environments.27 Stakeholder engagement throughout the review process is encouraged to ensure inclusion of multiple perspectives.22 Reporting standards for realist reviews and evaluation have been developed,29 however, specified methods for conducting realist reviews are variable.22 26 30
The main research question guiding this review is:
What works for whom and in what circumstances in relation to practitioners supporting people living with and beyond cancer to self-manage the long-term physical and psychosocial consequences on completing systemic anticancer therapies?
Pawson et al have proposed a method for conducting realist reviews.21 However, there is freedom to interpret the method and customise the steps.22 26 29 This review is guided by five steps, adapted from Pawson et al for conducting a realist review: (1) define the review scope, (2) develop initial programme theories, (3) search for evidence, (4) select and appraise evidence and (5) extract and synthesise data.21
