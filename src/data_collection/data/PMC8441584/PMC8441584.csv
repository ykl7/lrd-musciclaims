PMC8441584,"Whitaker9 described an analysis as ""reproducible"" in the narrow sense that a user can produce identical results provided the data and code from the original, and ""generalizable"" if it produces similar results when both data are swapped out for similar data (""replicability""), and if underlying code is swapped out with comparable replacements (""robustness"") (Figure 1).",PMC8441584_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Whitaker’s matrix of reproducibility

The term ""case studies"" is used in a general sense to describe any study of reproducibility.5 A reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. A refactor involves refactoring existing code into frameworks and reproducible best practices while preserving the original data. A replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. A test of robustness applies various protocols, workflows, statistical models, or parameters to a given dataset to study their effect on results. A census is a high-level tabulation conducted by a third party. A survey is a questionnaire sent to practitioners. A case narrative is an in-depth first-person account. An independent discussion uses a secondary independent author to interpret the results of a study as a means to improve inferential reproducibility.",./data/PMC8441584/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/044c/8441584/57c92979dbb8/gr2.jpg
