  "figure_2": "Case studies in reproducible research\nThe term \"case studies\" is used in a general sense to describe any study of reproducibility.5 A reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. A refactor involves refactoring existing code into frameworks and reproducible best practices while preserving the original data. A replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. A test of robustness applies various protocols, workflows, statistical models, or parameters to a given dataset to study their effect on results. A census is a high-level tabulation conducted by a third party. A survey is a questionnaire sent to practitioners. A case narrative is an in-depth first-person account. An independent discussion uses a secondary independent author to interpret the results of a study as a means to improve inferential reproducibility.",
