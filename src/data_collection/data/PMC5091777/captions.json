The order of constructs in the figure caption key reflects the highest to lowest activity in the curves. (c) GFP intensity value (±SEM) in soybean hairy roots transformed with intron deletion and translocation constructs. Images of root tips on top of columns represent the average intensity of GFP expression driven by the corresponding promoter construct. Overlapping columns show no significant differences between constructs by the t test (LSD) at p<0.05.",

The order of constructs in the figure caption key reflects the highest to lowest activity in the curves. (c) GFP intensity value (±SEM) in soybean hairy roots regulated by different intron partial deletion constructs. Images of root tips on top of columns represent the average intensity of GFP expression driven by the corresponding promoter construct.

The order of constructs in the figure caption key reflects the highest to lowest activity in the curves. GFP expression is presented as “GFP Expression” rather than percent of a control because expression values for two different core promoters are presented. (c) GFP intensity value (±SEM) in soybean hairy roots transformed with different synthetic promoter constructs. Images of root tips on top of columns represent the average intensity of GFP expression driven by the corresponding promoter construct. Overlapping columns show no significant differences between constructs by the t test (LSD) at p<0.05.",
