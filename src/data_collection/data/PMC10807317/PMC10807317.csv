PMC10807317,"At least four cell cycle checkpoints may be deregulated in breast cancer (BC) cells: the restriction point (G0/G1), the G1 checkpoint (G1/S), the G2 checkpoint (G2/M) and the mitosis‐associated spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (Figure 1).",PMC10807317_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,"Graphical simplification of cell cycle phases, checkpoints and regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer.",./data/PMC10807317/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/de3f/10807317/96d28dc73a20/CTM2-14-e1544-g001.jpg
PMC10807317,"From a mechanistic standpoint, genomic alterations associated with resistance may be divided into two categories: resistance through the disruption of the cell cycle machinery (including alterations in RB1, CCNE1, CDK6, CDK4, p16, CDK2, CDK7, CCND1 or INK) and resistance through compensatory upstream signalling (alterations in PI3K, PTEN, FGFR1/2, FAT1/HIPPO, ERBB2 or RAS signalling) (Figure 1).",PMC10807317_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,"Graphical simplification of cell cycle phases, checkpoints and regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer.",./data/PMC10807317/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/de3f/10807317/96d28dc73a20/CTM2-14-e1544-g001.jpg

 While the cyclin E‐CDK2 complex participates in the G1/S phase transition through RB1 phosphorylation, CDK7 exerts a wider role in cell cycle progress by acting as a CDK‐activating kinase (Figure 1).",PMC10807317_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,"Graphical simplification of cell cycle phases, checkpoints and regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer.",./data/PMC10807317/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/de3f/10807317/96d28dc73a20/CTM2-14-e1544-g001.jpg

Entry into S phase is essentially controlled by the CDK2/cyclinA complex, where CDK2 is activated by CDK4/6‐dependent E2F upregulation and by CDK7, and inhibited by DNA damage‐mediated cdc25A and WEE1 (Figure 1).",PMC10807317_figure_1,FIGURE 1.,"Graphical simplification of cell cycle phases, checkpoints and regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer.",./data/PMC10807317/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/de3f/10807317/96d28dc73a20/CTM2-14-e1544-g001.jpg
