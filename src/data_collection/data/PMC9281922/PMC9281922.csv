PMC9281922,"The standard anthocyanin, C3G, had the maximum absorbance at 530 nm (Figure 1:1), confirming the maximum absorbance of 530 nm for anthocyanins in assessed samples.",PMC9281922_figure_1,Figure 1.,"The absorption spectrum of (1) Cyanidin‐3‐Glucoside standard solution used as internal control, strawberry anthocyanin extracted by methanol method (2) after 24 hr incubation, and (3) after 48 hr incubation",./data/PMC9281922/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f3c/9281922/68d5424902e5/FSN3-10-2123-g001.jpg
PMC9281922,"Also, their absorption spectra were very similar in all wavelengths, as well as the anthocyanin absorption area of 530 nm (Figure 1:2,3).",PMC9281922_figure_1,Figure 1.,"The absorption spectrum of (1) Cyanidin‐3‐Glucoside standard solution used as internal control, strawberry anthocyanin extracted by methanol method (2) after 24 hr incubation, and (3) after 48 hr incubation",./data/PMC9281922/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f3c/9281922/68d5424902e5/FSN3-10-2123-g001.jpg
PMC9281922,"Therefore, the absorption spectrum of the chloroform fraction was also measured (Figure 2:5).",PMC9281922_figure_2,Figure 2.,"The absorption spectrum of strawberry anthocyanin extracted by (1) methanol extract after 24 hr, (2) chloroform‐methanol extract, (3) methanol extract in samples with MgO, (4) chloroform‐methanol extract in samples with MgO, (5) chloroform fraction (CLF) showing chloroform‐soluble impurities, and (6) chloroform fraction showing chloroform‐soluble impurities in samples with MgO",./data/PMC9281922/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f3c/9281922/6690b3f0cdf5/FSN3-10-2123-g002.jpg
PMC9281922,"The results have shown that the addition of MgO in both methanol and chloroform‐methanol methods decreased the absorbance of the samples significantly at 530 nm (Figure 2:3,5).",PMC9281922_figure_2,Figure 2.,"The absorption spectrum of strawberry anthocyanin extracted by (1) methanol extract after 24 hr, (2) chloroform‐methanol extract, (3) methanol extract in samples with MgO, (4) chloroform‐methanol extract in samples with MgO, (5) chloroform fraction (CLF) showing chloroform‐soluble impurities, and (6) chloroform fraction showing chloroform‐soluble impurities in samples with MgO",./data/PMC9281922/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f3c/9281922/6690b3f0cdf5/FSN3-10-2123-g002.jpg
PMC9281922,"This method had lower anthocyanin absorption than the methanol method (Table 1) and a smaller absorption spectrum (Figure 3:1,2).",PMC9281922_figure_3,Figure 3.,"The absorption spectrum of strawberry anthocyanin extracted by (1) methanol extract after 24 hr, (2) chloroform‐methanol extract as in Neff and Chory (1998), (3) pH differential method, pH1, (4) pH differential method, pH4.5, (5) methanol extract followed by pH differential method, pH 1, as in Gauche et al.

PMC9281922,"The anthocyanin concentration in the pH differential method (pH 1.0) was lower than the methanol method (Table 1, Figure 3:1,3), meaning less anthocyanin was extracted.",PMC9281922_figure_3,Figure 3.,"The absorption spectrum of strawberry anthocyanin extracted by (1) methanol extract after 24 hr, (2) chloroform‐methanol extract as in Neff and Chory (1998), (3) pH differential method, pH1, (4) pH differential method, pH4.5, (5) methanol extract followed by pH differential method, pH 1, as in Gauche et al.
