In ND, we defined the calibration densities on calibration nodes either with narrower (NDn) or broader (NDb) log normal priors on age. NDu is the analog of NDb with uniform priors. In FBD, we defined the fossil age either using a minimum age (FBD tip date) or an age range (FBD age range). Each dating method was carried out with a smaller (s) or larger (l) fossil set (fossil number for each approach indicated in square brackets). Since node dating only uses the oldest fossil per node, this resulted in fewer fossils used in the small and the large fossil set in ND compared to FBD. A control run (FBDs/l_ctrl) was additionally executed for FBD in which exactly the same fossils as in NDs/l were used",
