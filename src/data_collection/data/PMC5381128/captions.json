  "figure_1": "Flow chart illustrating the different dating methods applied. We used both the node dating (ND) and the fossilized birth-death (FBD) method. In ND, we defined the calibration densities on calibration nodes either with narrower (NDn) or broader (NDb) log normal priors on age. NDu is the analog of NDb with uniform priors. In FBD, we defined the fossil age either using a minimum age (FBD tip date) or an age range (FBD age range). Each dating method was carried out with a smaller (s) or larger (l) fossil set (fossil number for each approach indicated in square brackets). Since node dating only uses the oldest fossil per node, this resulted in fewer fossils used in the small and the large fossil set in ND compared to FBD. A control run (FBDs/l_ctrl) was additionally executed for FBD in which exactly the same fossils as in NDs/l were used",
  "figure_2": "Inferred maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from results of the FBDl method (fossilized birth-death method, based on the larger set of 21 fossils). Nodes with red dots indicate Bayesian posterior probabilities lower than 0.95, while all other nodes have posterior probabilities higher than 0.95. Light blue lines on nodes represent the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) of the inferred phylogenetic trees. The node labels (a-s) indicate those nodes represented in Fig. 3. The geological timescale is in million years and the paleogeographic maps on top were redrawn from [85]",
  "figure_3": "Comparison of estimated node ages of the 19 major clades of Pinus across all applied dating approaches. a: Densities of effect sizes originate from a mixed-effect model and illustrate to what degree the estimated node ages differ among dating approaches (different colors; see legend) and among fossil sets (1. darker colors for the large, 2. brighter colors for the small fossil set; see legend). The 95% confidence intervals of effect sizes are illustrated with a line below the density curves. Non-overlap of these intervals indicates significant difference on node ages among all 19 nodes. b: Boxplots illustrate the estimated node ages across dating approaches and fossil sets for the major clades (a-s illustrated in Fig. 2). Whiskers span the 95% highest probability density (HPD), while boxes span the 50% HPD, with the median node age indicated by a vertical bar. The x-axis indicates the geological time in million years. Symbols represent average node ages as estimated in the following studies: Gernandt et al. [16] (filled circle), illustrating estimates resulting from two different calibration scenarios; Hao et al. [13] (filled upward triangles); Willyard et al. [15] (filled squares), illustrating the estimates based on both the chloroplast and the nuclear sequence data, but only presenting results of their 85 Ma calibration scenario as this was indicated to be more realistic; Hernandez-Leon et al. [18] (open upward triangle); He et al. [11] (open circles); Leslie et al. [47] (open squares); Geada Lopez [48] (crosses); Eckert and Hall. [14] (open downward triangle). The following abbreviations are used. FBD: fossilized birth-death method; ND: node dating method; l: analyses based on the large fossil set; s: analyses based on the small fossil set; n: narrow calibration priors in ND based on the geological age of the respective fossil; b: broad calibration priors in ND",
  "figure_4": "Sensitivity of the time calibration to single fossil exclusion for the fossilized birth-death approaches (FBD). This test measures the difference in age estimates of the 19 major nodes (a-s, see also Fig. 3) when keeping versus removing single calibration constraints (fossil, labeled on x-axis) at a time. We illustrate results from the small (a) and the large (b) fossil set. Letters (see Fig. 2 for assignment) indicate nodes with highest deviations"
