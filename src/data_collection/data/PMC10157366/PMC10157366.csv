PMC10157366,"Sensor, transducer, and effector proteins (from Fig. 3A schematic) were analyzed in OV81, PEO-1, and PEO-C42.",PMC10157366_figure_3,Figure 3.,"SMAP-061–induced baseline DNA damage accumulation is a result of the inhibition of HR signaling output, including DNA damage repair and cell-cycle regulation mechanisms. A, Schematic of the HR pathway, representing the DNA sensors (RPA and H2Ax) that detect damage, the transducers (BRCA1/2, ATM, and CHK1/2) that can amplify and transmit those damage signals to the effectors (RAD51, WEE1, and CDC25A), which ultimately regulate DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint activity. Ultimately, when the HR output is successfully transmitted to the sensors by RAD51, HGSC baseline DNA damage is kept low and homeostasis is restored, allowing cells to survive long-term with inherent DNA errors due to genomic instability (GI). However, when SMAPs are added, PP2A gets activated, allowing for (i) RAD51 expression to be inhibited and (ii) leading to the HR effectors’ function to be chronically impaired. This results in the incapacity of the cells to restore cell-cycle progression and DNA damage repair, eventually dying to self-triggered apoptosis (schematic created with BioRender.com).
