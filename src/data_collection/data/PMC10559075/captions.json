  "figure_2": "The number of publications from 2000 to 2022. The bar chart depicts the total number of publications in the field up to the current year. The red dashed line depicts a linear relationship between the year of publication and the overall number of publications.",
  "figure_3": "Contributions from various nations/regions to the investigation of macrophage polarization in RA. (A) Regional map of the RA macrophage polarization studies' global spread. Different nations are represented by various hues depending on the number of articles published. More articles have been published when the color is redder; fewer articles have been published when the color is bluer. Because the map program cannot search for specific regions, we have provided the country in which the area is located directly. (B) Bubble charts in NC and AC for the top 10 nations/regions. The bubble's size and color signify AC; the larger and redder the bubble, the higher the AC; the smaller and greener the lower AC. The horizontal axis stands for NC. (C) A network diagram based on the study of country/regional collaboration and time-course-visualized using VOSviewer. NP: number of publications; NC: number of citations; AC: average number of citations per item.",
  "figure_4": "Visual analysis of institutes and funds. (A) Visualization of the frequency of publications at each university. Each institution published at least three publications. The node size reflects the frequency of institutes, the curve represents the cooperative connection of institutes, and nodes of the same color represent the same cluster. (B) The time evolution of publications from various institutes. (C) Frequency radar map of the top ten funds.",
  "figure_5": "Visual analysis of journals. (A) Visual analysis of journals published at least three publications in each journal. (B) The evolution of several journal publications. (C) Visualization of co-cited journals that have been cited at least 20 times. (D) Density map of co-cited journals.",
  "figure_6": "Visual analysis by the authors. (A) Visual analysis of the authors, with a minimum of two publications per author. (B) The evolution of output results from different scholars. (C) Visualization of co-cited authors that have been cited at least 10 times. (D) Density map of co-cited authors.",
  "figure_7": "Visual analysis of references. (A) A reference co-occurrence analysis. Each article was cited at least ten times. (B) Density map of preference. (C) The seven citations with the most intense bursts (sorted by year of bursts onset). The blue line represents the time when the citation appeared, and the red line is the time when the bursts happened."
