  "figure_2": "Course of raw pressure signal with characteristic touchdown behavior leading to overpressure at 2.8 seconds. The pre-evaluation phase from 0 to 5 seconds is not further evaluated. Starting from 5 seconds, the impulses were evaluated for IOP estimation (gray area). The pressure chamber was considered to be airtight.",
  "figure_3": "(Top) Regression plot of the ANN result. (Bottom) Bland–Altman plot of the self-tonometer results (ST) in reference to the GAT measurements. The achieved measurement uncertainty is calculated only from test data that was not used in the iterative ANN training and amounts to 6.53 mm Hg (kp = 2)."
