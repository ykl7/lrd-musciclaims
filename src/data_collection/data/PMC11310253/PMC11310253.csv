PMC11310253,Integration of HRVB with occupationally relevant training: iPREP HRVB skills are conditioned during reality-based training (RBT) scenarios that are: a) representative of officers’ field duties (Fig. 2) and b) can be seamlessly and conveniently integrated with existing RBT practices and agency resources.,PMC11310253_figure_2,Fig. 2.,"Example of a law enforcement reality-based training (RBT) exercise. RBT uses props and infrastructure to stage various environments (e.g., apartment, rooming house) in dedicated training rooms at individual agencies or at real locations (e.g., decommissioned schools or buildings). Experienced police instructors or trained actors deliver scripted behaviors that are designed to elicit, train, or evaluate specific skills (i.e., de-escalation, verbal communication, positioning, physical maneuvers, critical decision-making) based on predetermined outcomes (e.g., subject will comply with officer commands; subject will not comply, requiring a use of force).
