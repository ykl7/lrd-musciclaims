  "figure_2": "Example of a law enforcement reality-based training (RBT) exercise. RBT uses props and infrastructure to stage various environments (e.g., apartment, rooming house) in dedicated training rooms at individual agencies or at real locations (e.g., decommissioned schools or buildings). Experienced police instructors or trained actors deliver scripted behaviors that are designed to elicit, train, or evaluate specific skills (i.e., de-escalation, verbal communication, positioning, physical maneuvers, critical decision-making) based on predetermined outcomes (e.g., subject will comply with officer commands; subject will not comply, requiring a use of force).

  "figure_3": "Physiological arousal and performance. a The combination of high sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system activation is an adaptive physiological state that supports effective performance in physical/motoric, cognitive, and social domains. b While high SNS activation is adaptive for purely physical activities, such as running or lifting, it is not adaptive for sustained performance of cognitive, social or fine motor skills. c Heart rate arousal curve, based on the Yerkes Dodson model (1908), accumulated evidence from applied research (Di Nota & Huhta, 2019) and the co-authors collective experience in clinical, applied, and psychophysiological research",
  "figure_4": "The Reset Breath in action. This is a screenshot of the HRV Trace app showing a 2-min portion of continuous heart rate (HR) data obtained from a physician during a live-action scenario (see ‘Technological developments for HRVB in field settings’ section for further details). Each purple dot represents a single heartbeat plotted continuously over time (x axis) in beats per minute (BPM, plotted on y axis). A Anticipatory stress increases HR from approximately 65 to 100 BPM as the physician waits to enter the scenario room. B First Reset Breath is performed to manually decrease HR and return to an adaptive physiological state with a refocus on the patient. C Second and third Reset Breaths performed to maintain adaptive physiological state. D Patient physically attacks physician and HR monitor is disrupted. E HR remains elevated due to the recent physical activity of self-defense, increasing oxygen demands on the body. F Acute physiological recovery is achieved by engaging in two successive Reset Breaths, returning the physician’s HR and physiological state to near pre-scenario levels upon completion of the scenario.

The modelled body position provides several physiological and tactical advantages, including postural stability and improved groundedness, directed gaze and attention towards central cues, and increased readiness to mobilize for action.

  "figure_6": "Sample image of HRVB integrated with police RBT. In the HRV Team version of the HRVB app, multiple users’ real-time beat-to-beat heart rate can be visualized (shown by the purple dots plotted in beats per minute on the y-axis and successive beats over time on the x-axis) by configuring the Bluetooth input from multiple wearables.

  "figure_7": "Contrasting heart rate variability during rest and recovery as shown on the HRV Trace app. a Continuous heart rate during resting non-paced breathing. b Heart rate during paced Recovery Breathing. This individual’s preferred Recovery Breathing pace is 5.5 breaths per minute, which is demonstrated here for 69 s. c Heart rate breathing at 7.2 breaths per minute for a duration of approximately 2 min. The green vertical line denotes a start marker in the HRV Trace training mode and the yellow vertical line is an end marker. This is not an optimal Recovery Breathing pace based on poor wave amplitude as indicated in extant HRVB breathing protocols as well as subjective ratings of respiratory discomfort, which previous breathing protocols do not account for (Balban et al., 2023; Lehrer et al., 2013; Steffen et al., 2017; Vaschillo et al., 2006). d Heart rate breathing at 4.0 breaths per minute for a duration of approximately 2 min. Visual inspection of the waveform indicates a somewhat smooth and consistent sinusoidal pattern, but inconsistent peak-to-trough amplitude and not comfortable according to the participant. Therefore, this would not be recommended as an optimal Recovery Breathing pace. Data images provided by J.P. Andersen",
  "figure_8": "HRV Trace paced breathing training setting. a Users can practice breathing at Recovery Breathing paces using audiovisual guides that vary by 0.2 breaths per minute and range from 4.0 to 10.0 breaths per minute. Video training guides can be played by tapping the triangular icon to the left of the pace. Once users identify their own unique Recovery Breathing pace, they can save it as a favorite by tapping the star icon to the right of the pace. b Each paced breathing video presents an audiovisual guide indicated by a triangle that grows and the word INHALE presented beneath it in time with the paced inhalation, and shrinks with the word EXHALE presented beneath it in time with the paced exhalation, which is slightly longer than the inhalation duration (2:3 ratio). An auditory prompt also indicates when to “inhale” and “exhale” along in time with the selected pace"
