PMC11878535,The levels and diurnal patterns of subjective stress and the occurrence of sexual desire and arousal during the 14 consecutive days of data collection are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2.,PMC11878535_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Diurnal patterns of (A) subjective stress, (B) occurrence of sexual desire, and (C) occurrence of sexual arousal. Higher values indicate higher probability of occurrence or higher levels of the construct.

PMC11878535,"However, when including a cross-level interaction with gender, the main effect was not significant, but the cross-level interaction was significant, showing that previous sexual activity was associated with lower subjective stress in women, while this trend was less clear in men (UC = −0.26, P = .020) (see Figure 3).",PMC11878535_figure_3,Figure 3.,"Three-level multilevel model on the association between sexual activity and subsequent subjective stress levels, showing the cross-level interaction of gender.",./data/PMC11878535/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b247/11878535/52f2055f3daa/kaaf007_fig3.jpg
