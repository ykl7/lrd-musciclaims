PMC9053433,"For this study, heterozygous adults for the novel stl159 lesion were crossed to produce homozygous wild-type and heterozygous stl159/+ siblings, which have a normal patterning phenotype called “wild-type”, and stl159 homozygous mutants, which have broad mispatterning of the peripheral nervous system referred to as “mutant” (Figure 1).",PMC9053433_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Lateral schematic of key nervous system features in a zebrafish larva.
