Motor nerves are shown emanating from spinal cord. Boundaries of body wall muscle segments (somites) are shown in gray. Compass denotes dorsal (D)-ventral (V) and anterior (A)-posterior (P) axes. (B–E) Patterning of wild-type sibling (B–C) and stl159 mutant (D–E) larvae at 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf). (B, D) Brightfield lateral view shows normal melanocyte patterning in sibling and disrupted in mutant (arrowhead). (C, E) Merged nbt:dsRed; sox10:megfp fluorescence in larvae shown in B and D indicating features scored by students. PLLn position is marked with white arrow, spinal cord is marked with bracket, subset of motor nerves from spinal cord are marked with asterisks. PLLn and motor nerve phenotype are disrupted in stl159 mutants. Merged image created in Fiji; students scored merged or single channel images depending on research question.",
