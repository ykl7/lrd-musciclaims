PMC10593100,"These conditions also allowed us to test whether the strength of the constraint mattered: The Persistence (Successful) condition indicates a relatively weak constraint (i.e., the agent can jump three times and could get the better option), whereas the Persistence (Failed condition) indicates a strong constraint (i.e., jumping does not make a difference for the outcome).Results

PMC10593100,"Do you think that Cody likes the yellow ball (selected toy) more than the multi-colored ball (unselected toy)? Yes or no?”
As in Study 1, we also assessed participants’ judgments about the strength of the constraint with the question, “How hard would it have been for Cody to get the multi-colored ball from the locked toy box? A little hard, or really hard?”Results
