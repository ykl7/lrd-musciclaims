PMC11224056,"These findings constitute a new model of asthenozoospermia pathogenesis that combines genetics, proteomics, signal transduction, and molecular biology today (Fig. 1).",PMC11224056_figure_1,Fig. 1.,"Schematic diagram of the mechanism underlying the role of STYXL1 in spermatogenesis. a Levels of STYXL1 content change as the spermatogenesis cycle progresses. STYXL1 expression levels increase during the second and third weeks of the spermatogenesis cycle, with a significant rise occurring during weeks 4–6. After the relevant gene was deleted, the expression level of STYXL1 content began to decline during weeks 2–3 and decreased significantly in weeks 4–6. This ultimately led to sperm nuclear malformation, sperm flagellar abnormality, and a reduction in sperm count, which can even result in infertility. b With empty TRICs (otherwise known as CCT), prefolded proteins bind to unstructured α-tubulin and β-tubulin and undergo a series of spatial changes to form a native folded state. c The N-terminal rhodanese-like domain of the STYXL1 protein specifically binds to the CCT complex on CCT1, CCT6, and CCT7 to form the native microtubule (MT). This microtubule plays a physiological role in normal sperm cells along with structures such as outer dense fibers (ODF) and central microtubule pairs (CP)",./data/PMC11224056/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/917d/11224056/b5a432132f88/10815_2024_3122_Fig1_HTML.jpg
