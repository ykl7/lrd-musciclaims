  "figure_1": "The pathway for recovery and mental health promotion approach\nFig. 1. This figure illustrates the pathway for recovery and mental health promotion approach, which outlines a potential care pathway to help shift a wider distribution of the population more towards mental well-being and further away from mental ill health through a family of MBCT curricula adapted for more general population samples. The curricula included within the figure are: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy-Finding Peace in a Frantic World (M-FP), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Life (MBCTL), and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy-Taking it Further (MBCT-TiF).",
  "figure_2": "CONSORT Flow Diagram\nNote. Fig. 2 depicts the CONSORT flow diagram, outlining those assessed for eligibility, randomized, and included for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The number of those who dropped out, due to discontinuation or adverse event, and who did not complete pre- and/or post-assessments was recorded. Two participants discontinued in the MBCT-TiF arm for the following reasons: no longer eligible and time commitment issue. One adverse event (i.e., hospitalization) was reported in MBCT-TiF arm, which was deemed unrelated to the intervention. Two adverse events were reported in the CONTROL arm (i.e., cancer diagnoses) but were deemed unrelated to the intervention. Cohort 1 was recruited and enrolled in June 2021 and cohort 2 was recruited in September 2021 and enrolled in October 2021. The minimum dose for the MBCT-TiF arm was half (six) of the total (twelve) sessions. MBCT-TiF: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy–Taking it Further; CONTROL: Ongoing Mindfulness Practice (OMP)."
