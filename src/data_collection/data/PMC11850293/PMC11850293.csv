As shown in Fig. 2, of the 164 participants, 83 were randomized to MBCT-TiF and 81 to OMP.",PMC11850293_figure_2,Fig. 2.,"CONSORT Flow Diagram
Note. Fig. 2 depicts the CONSORT flow diagram, outlining those assessed for eligibility, randomized, and included for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The number of those who dropped out, due to discontinuation or adverse event, and who did not complete pre- and/or post-assessments was recorded. Two participants discontinued in the MBCT-TiF arm for the following reasons: no longer eligible and time commitment issue. One adverse event (i.e., hospitalization) was reported in MBCT-TiF arm, which was deemed unrelated to the intervention. Two adverse events were reported in the CONTROL arm (i.e., cancer diagnoses) but were deemed unrelated to the intervention. Cohort 1 was recruited and enrolled in June 2021 and cohort 2 was recruited in September 2021 and enrolled in October 2021. The minimum dose for the MBCT-TiF arm was half (six) of the total (twelve) sessions.
