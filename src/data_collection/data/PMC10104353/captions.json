ICTRP, International Clinical Trial Registry Portal; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses.\n\naFour conference abstracts were excluded as the studies were later reported in a journal article.\n\nbResults from O’Hanlon 1986 were not used in the meta-analysis.",
  "figure_3": "Pairwise random-effects meta-analysis of difference in SDLP between zopiclone and placebo in healthy volunteers. BAC, blood alcohol concentration; CI, confidence interval; PBO, placebo; ZOP, zopiclone. Note: Day 9 denotes driving test after ZOP on Day 1 and Day 8.\n Confidence intervals for individual studies may vary from those reported by study authors as they are based on z-statistic.",
