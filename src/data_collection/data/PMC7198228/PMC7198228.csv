Students ranked their confidence/comfort with reading scientific papers, understanding graphs/tables/figures, determining a hypothesis, understanding the methods used, and identifying potential problems/pitfalls in the work. All scores were averaged and statistical analysis was performed using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test when there was not a normal distribution.

PMC7198228,"Conversely, students in Microbiology admitted that they struggled with articles (Fig. 7F) and did not have significant gains in comfort/confidence (Fig. 4F), as would be expected since no journals were required to be read/discussed in the course.",PMC7198228_figure_4,FIGURE 4.,"Self-rating of student comfort/confidence when reading journal articles.

PMC7198228,"However, it should be noted that students in Advanced Cell Physiology correctly assessed their own ability, declaring that they are more confident and have fewer struggles (Fig. 4A and 7A) with journal articles at the end of the course, which coincides with improved scores (Fig. 1A).",PMC7198228_figure_4,FIGURE 4.,"Self-rating of student comfort/confidence when reading journal articles.
