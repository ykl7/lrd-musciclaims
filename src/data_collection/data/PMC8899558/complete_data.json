      "caption": "Restimulating activated T cells with anti-CD3 in the presence of IL-2 will cause a certain percentage of T cells to induce apoptosis. Anti-CD28 does not seem to be a contributor to this phenomenon, despite its requirement for T cell activation. Simulation of RICD through in vitro assays may be performed, testing cells anywhere from day 4 post-activation to day 15. Modulation of T cells, such as siRNA knockdown of various proteins, can occur before day 0 activation with CD3/CD28. After IL-2 addition to in vitro cultures of T cells on day 3, RICD may be tested in “early stage” effector cells (day 4) or “late stage” effector cells (day 14). Comparing control and siRNA knockdown cells helps elucidate mechanistic and molecular requirements for RICD sensitivity. Figure created using Biorender.com.",

The Pasteur pipette is placed in the mixture so the tip rests in the conical portion of the tube. A 10 mL serological pipette is filled with Ficoll and gently rested on the opening of the Pasteur pipette, slowly depositing 3 mL of Ficoll or until the pipette is full. The process of refilling the serological pipette, and distributing the Ficoll in increments no greater than 3 mL, occurs until 13 mL is present in each centrifuge tube. B. The final product of Steps A7 and A8 should resemble this panel. The Pasteur pipette was removed slowly as to not disturb the Ficoll layered on the bottom. There is only a small presence of RBC in the Ficoll. The solutions are now able to be slowly transferred to the centrifuge.",
