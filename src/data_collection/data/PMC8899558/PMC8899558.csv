PMC8899558,RICD relies on the presence of antigen and interleukin-2 (IL-2) to induce programmed cell death in a subset of activated T cells following TCR re-engagement (Figure 1).,PMC8899558_figure_1,"Figure 1. 
RICD sensitivity in activated T cells increases over time and may be imitated and investigated in an in vitro format.","Restimulating activated T cells with anti-CD3 in the presence of IL-2 will cause a certain percentage of T cells to induce apoptosis. Anti-CD28 does not seem to be a contributor to this phenomenon, despite its requirement for T cell activation. Simulation of RICD through in vitro assays may be performed, testing cells anywhere from day 4 post-activation to day 15. Modulation of T cells, such as siRNA knockdown of various proteins, can occur before day 0 activation with CD3/CD28. After IL-2 addition to in vitro cultures of T cells on day 3, RICD may be tested in “early stage” effector cells (day 4) or “late stage” effector cells (day 14). Comparing control and siRNA knockdown cells helps elucidate mechanistic and molecular requirements for RICD sensitivity.

PMC8899558,"Distribute 13 mL of Ficoll Plus into each 50 mL tube through the Pasteur pipette using a 10 mL serological pipette tip and Pipette Aid (pipette by adding 3 ml aliquots of Ficoll at a time, repeat until 13 mL is added), creating a clear distinct Ficoll bottom layer under the sample/PBS mixture top layer as depicted in Figure 2 and Video 1.",PMC8899558_figure_2,Figure 2. Addition of Ficoll for PBMC isolation.,"A. The set-up for Ficoll distribution is depicted. Two 50 mL centrifuge tubes have equal portions of the sample/PBS mixture. The Pasteur pipette is placed in the mixture so the tip rests in the conical portion of the tube. A 10 mL serological pipette is filled with Ficoll and gently rested on the opening of the Pasteur pipette, slowly depositing 3 mL of Ficoll or until the pipette is full. The process of refilling the serological pipette, and distributing the Ficoll in increments no greater than 3 mL, occurs until 13 mL is present in each centrifuge tube. B. The final product of Steps A7 and A8 should resemble this panel. The Pasteur pipette was removed slowly as to not disturb the Ficoll layered on the bottom. There is only a small presence of RBC in the Ficoll. The solutions are now able to be slowly transferred to the centrifuge.",./data/PMC8899558/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c954/8899558/082fe125b3f0/BioProtoc-12-04-4326-g002.jpg
PMC8899558,"Using a 5 mL serological pipette tip, gently collect the white layer of PBMC sitting at the plasma:Ficoll gradient interface and place it into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube, as shown in Figure 3.",PMC8899558_figure_3,Figure 3. Isolation of the PBMC layer after Ficoll separation.,"A. After the Ficoll gradient is formed via centrifugation, the white PBMC layer will become apparent (shown by the red arrow). The PBMC layer should have few RBCs. B. Removal of the white PBMC layer may be achieved by using the 5 mL serological pipette tip and delicately placing the tip on top of the PBMC layer, slowly removing it while avoiding the serum (above) and Ficoll (below). Angling the tube may help.",./data/PMC8899558/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c954/8899558/d1d48f72816a/BioProtoc-12-04-4326-g003.jpg
PMC8899558,Add 100 μL of the cell suspension into each well of the 96-well plate as shown in Figure 4 (6 wells total).,PMC8899558_figure_4,Figure 4. RICD assay set-up in a 96-well plate. The RICD assay should be formulated in a way where two types of controls are present.,"A control condition, consisting of either unaltered cells or control treatment (such as transfected non-specific siRNA), and a control triplicate where OKT3 is not added. Each condition, control or experimental, will consist of six wells: three containing OKT3 and three without it. Any number of conditions can be added to the plate.

PMC8899558,"Events recorded can be pulled from the Accuri C6 program from gates that were established during data acquisition, or from gates redrawn and established using another analysis program such as FlowJo (Figure 5).",PMC8899558_figure_5,Figure 5. Flow cytometry output and RICD calculation. Illustrated here is our data analysis workflow from flow cytometry to RICD calculation using viable cell events.,"A. In the dot plots FSC vs. PI (FL-2), example images are present for early vs. late stage CD8 T cells (instead of the triplicate images usually acquired). The larger decrease in viable cell numbers can be appreciated in late stage populations, both for control and TIM-3 KD, due to increased RICD sensitivity at this time point. The decrease in viable cell events in +OKT3 compared to the corresponding -OKT3 plot can also be observed. Similar to what was published, loss of TIM-3 early stage exacerbated RICD while loss of TIM-3 late stage was protective towards RICD. B.
