  "figure_1": "Restimulating activated T cells with anti-CD3 in the presence of IL-2 will cause a certain percentage of T cells to induce apoptosis. Anti-CD28 does not seem to be a contributor to this phenomenon, despite its requirement for T cell activation. Simulation of RICD through in vitro assays may be performed, testing cells anywhere from day 4 post-activation to day 15. Modulation of T cells, such as siRNA knockdown of various proteins, can occur before day 0 activation with CD3/CD28. After IL-2 addition to in vitro cultures of T cells on day 3, RICD may be tested in “early stage” effector cells (day 4) or “late stage” effector cells (day 14). Comparing control and siRNA knockdown cells helps elucidate mechanistic and molecular requirements for RICD sensitivity. Figure created using Biorender.com.",
  "figure_2": "A. The set-up for Ficoll distribution is depicted. Two 50 mL centrifuge tubes have equal portions of the sample/PBS mixture. The Pasteur pipette is placed in the mixture so the tip rests in the conical portion of the tube. A 10 mL serological pipette is filled with Ficoll and gently rested on the opening of the Pasteur pipette, slowly depositing 3 mL of Ficoll or until the pipette is full. The process of refilling the serological pipette, and distributing the Ficoll in increments no greater than 3 mL, occurs until 13 mL is present in each centrifuge tube. B. The final product of Steps A7 and A8 should resemble this panel. The Pasteur pipette was removed slowly as to not disturb the Ficoll layered on the bottom. There is only a small presence of RBC in the Ficoll. The solutions are now able to be slowly transferred to the centrifuge.",
  "figure_3": "A. After the Ficoll gradient is formed via centrifugation, the white PBMC layer will become apparent (shown by the red arrow). The PBMC layer should have few RBCs. B. Removal of the white PBMC layer may be achieved by using the 5 mL serological pipette tip and delicately placing the tip on top of the PBMC layer, slowly removing it while avoiding the serum (above) and Ficoll (below). Angling the tube may help.",
  "figure_4": "A control condition, consisting of either unaltered cells or control treatment (such as transfected non-specific siRNA), and a control triplicate where OKT3 is not added. Each condition, control or experimental, will consist of six wells: three containing OKT3 and three without it. Any number of conditions can be added to the plate.

  "figure_5": "A. In the dot plots FSC vs. PI (FL-2), example images are present for early vs. late stage CD8 T cells (instead of the triplicate images usually acquired). The larger decrease in viable cell numbers can be appreciated in late stage populations, both for control and TIM-3 KD, due to increased RICD sensitivity at this time point. The decrease in viable cell events in +OKT3 compared to the corresponding -OKT3 plot can also be observed. Similar to what was published, loss of TIM-3 early stage exacerbated RICD while loss of TIM-3 late stage was protective towards RICD. B. A typical event record and calculation of percentage cell loss using the formula provided above with example RICD sensitivity seen at day 4 post-activation between NS (non-specific siRNA) control cells and TIM-3 KD."
