PMC11866458,"Because we aimed to differentiate theoretically meaningful profiles from undifferentiated profiles, we selected the 3-profile over the 2-profile solution at each age, after Wald Z-tests confirmed all profiles were significantly different in key indicator means (see Figure 1), because the former was supported by better class separation, adequate percent membership in each profile, and theoretically-meaningful structure.",PMC11866458_figure_1,Figure 1.
