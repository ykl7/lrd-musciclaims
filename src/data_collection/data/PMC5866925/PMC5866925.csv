Conceptual frameworks of different epidemic models.,"The colors represent epidemiological status: susceptible (S, blue), exposed (E, gray), infectious (I, red), and recovered (R, green). (A) Basic SIR compartmental model. Individuals are assumed to be well-mixed and are classified only according to their epidemiological status. (B) Vector-borne compartmental model. The subscripts H and M denote human and mosquito, respectively. Both host and vector individuals are assumed to be well-mixed and are classified only according to their epidemiological status. (C) Spatial model. Individuals are located at different locations. The transmission of infection between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual at distance x may occur with probability K(x). (D) Metapopulation model. The entire population is divided into two distinct subpopulations, each with independent disease transmission dynamics, together with interactions between subpopulations. The subpopulation in each patch is mixed homogeneously. (E) Network model. The model is formed by at least two basic components: vertex and edge. Vertices are connected by edges defined by the relationship of interest such as trade or travel. Infectious diseases are modeled to spread via the edges in this model. (F) Individual-based model. In this most complicated model, the stochastic epidemiological dynamics for each individual can be explicitly simulated with a set of characteristics including epidemiological status, spatial location, interaction preference, behavior traits, etc.",./data/PMC5866925/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/927e/5866925/4b1ceee78a79/peerj-06-4526-g001.jpg
