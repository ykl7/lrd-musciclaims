  "figure_1": "a) Illustration of tribometer configuration. Implant surfaces (10 mm radius) were secured to glass-bottomed culture dishes and to hydrogel probes with spherical shell geometry (6 mm radius of curvature) and fully submerged in ultrapure water to investigate shell-shell tribological interactions. b-e) Representative traces of implant surface profiles measured by scanning electron microscopy: Ra = 0.2 μm (tan); Ra = 2.7 μm (light green); Ra = 32 μm (teal); Ra = 80 μm (navy). Line scans illustrate prominent surface features that may interact in a folded implant scenario. f) One-dimensional power spectral density curves showing surface topography for silicone implants with Ra = 0.2 μm (tan); Ra = 2.7 μm (light green); Ra = 32 μm (teal); Ra = 80 μm (navy) using the SEM traces of implant surface profiles in (b-e).",
  "figure_2": "a) Distribution curves of the quantity and diameter of silicone elastomer breast implant wear debris particles generated after 1,000 mm of sliding in shell-on-shell configurations. Average particle diameter and standard deviation for implants with surface roughness: 8.3 ± 13.1 μm for Ra = 2.7 μm (solid light green); 4.7 ± 9.1 μm for Ra = 32 μm (dotted teal); 5.3 ± 3.3 μm for Ra = 80 μm (dashed navy). Representative widefield images under 40x magnification of implant wear debris particles diluted to 0.5% concentration of total particle volume in ultrapure water for b) Ra = 2.7 μm, c) Ra = 32 μm, and d) Ra = 80 μm."
