They explore the effects of this manipulation on perceived body weight, galvanic skin response (GSR), heel contact time (milliseconds) during walking, and acceleration of the foot’s upward movement during walking. All values are mean ± standard error. ∗Denotes a significant difference between means. [From Figure 4 of Tajadura-Jiménez et al. (2015a).

  "figure_5": "Results from Juravle and Spence’s (2011) study highlighting that movement-induced sensory perception changes are specific to the type of sensory input and its relevance to the movement. E1 refers to Experiment 1 and shows that the sensitivity (y-axis) in detecting a gap in tactile stimulation was lower when delivered to the hand that was juggling than when delivered to the hand at rest. E2 refers to Experiment 2 and shows that the sensitivity in detecting a gap in auditory stimuli was higher when delivered during the juggling condition. Box plots represent the middle 50% of data (dark line = median) and whiskers represent the interquartile range (+sign = values 1.5 times the inter-quartiles range).

  "figure_6": "Experimental set-up and results from Zampini and Spence’s (2004) study demonstrating the influence of manipulating biting sounds (airborne component) when biting into a potato chip. (A) Experimental set-up of participant; note that during testing, the booth door was closed and participants provided responses via computer screens situated through the wall (left-hand side) of the booth. (B) Perceived crispness of the chip (y-axis) during sound frequency alteration (x-axis) and 3 sound intensity conditions (0 dB, –20 dB, –40 dB). Results show that amplifying the high frequency components of the sound increased perceptions of crispness (unless sound is very quiet: –40 dB), and decreasing sound intensity increase perceptions of chip softness. (C) Perceived freshness of the chip (y-axis) during sound frequency alteration (x-axis) and 3 sound intensity conditions (0 dB, –20 dB, –40 dB). Amplifying the high frequency components of the sound increased perceptions of freshness (unless sound is very quiet: –40 dB), and decreasing sound intensity increase perceptions of chip staleness.
