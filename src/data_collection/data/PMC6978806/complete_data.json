(A) Experimental set-up of participant; note that during testing, the booth door was closed and participants provided responses via computer screens situated through the wall (left-hand side) of the booth. (B) Perceived crispness of the chip (y-axis) during sound frequency alteration (x-axis) and 3 sound intensity conditions (0 dB, –20 dB, –40 dB). Results show that amplifying the high frequency components of the sound increased perceptions of crispness (unless sound is very quiet: –40 dB), and decreasing sound intensity increase perceptions of chip softness. (C) Perceived freshness of the chip (y-axis) during sound frequency alteration (x-axis) and 3 sound intensity conditions (0 dB, –20 dB, –40 dB). Amplifying the high frequency components of the sound increased perceptions of freshness (unless sound is very quiet: –40 dB), and decreasing sound intensity increase perceptions of chip staleness.
