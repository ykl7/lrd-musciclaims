  "figure_1": "The transmittance spectrum of strawberry puree extracted by different extraction solvents after 48 h at 4 °C by Spectrophotometer CM-5. The solvents were (1) methanol (MeOH, Solovchenko et al. [6]), (2) methanol: water (MeOH:H2O, Neff and Chory [9]), (3) methanol: water (MeOH: H2O, Lindoo and Caldwell [7]), (4) ethanol (Karaaslan & Yaman 2017 [12]), (5) chloroform: methanol (Clf:MeOH, Solovchenko et al. [6]), (6) acetone (Garcia-Viguera et al. [17]), (7) water (Karaaslan & Yaman [12]), (8) pH differential buffers (Lee et al. [11]), (9) combined solvents (methanol: water and followed by pH differential; Gauch et al. [16]). The solvents were acidified by HCl (0.1%), except in Lindoo and Caldwell (1% HCl) and pH differential and combined solvents, where HCl was added to reach a certain pH (1.0 and 4.5). The extracts were stored at 4 °C for 48 h before measuring their transmittance.",

(A) L* and a* color parameters, (B) hue and chroma. The solvents were (1) methanol (MeOH, Solovchenko et al.
