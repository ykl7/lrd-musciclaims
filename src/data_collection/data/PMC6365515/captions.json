  "figure_1": "Schematic representation of sample preparation. Bovine alveolar macrophages (bAM) were isolated, post-mortem, from the lungs of age-matched male Holstein-Friesian calves by lavage. Purity of the cells was confirmed using flow cytometry with anti-CD14. Isolated cells were washed and seeded for 24 h prior to infection. Infected bAM were exposed to M. bovis at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 10:1 for 2 h. After 2 h the media was replaced in control and infected samples and cells were harvested after 24 h for analysis of DNA methylation. This figure was prepared by A.M.O’D. using the Biomedical PPT toolkit suite (www.motifolio.com).",

(B) Distribution of paired t-statistics between randomised samples based on smoothed WGBS data. (C) Distribution of average methylation level (%) in promoters and gene bodies across all samples. Only CpG loci with coverage greater or equal to 10 were considered. Only genes where gene body and promoter both had 10 or more sufficiently covered CpG loci were considered.",
  "figure_3": "Distribution of DNA methylation in different genomic contexts in non-infected and M. bovis-infected bovine alveolar macrophages (24 hpi). Analysis of WGBS data from M. bovis-infected and non-infected bovine alveolar macrophages (bAM) revealed that genomic methylation, in the context of CpGs, was not altered at any of the sequence features outlined (intergenic regions, gene bodies, or promoters with or without CpG islands (CGIs) in the host following infection. Blue and red violins represent non-infected and M. bovis-infected bAM, respectively.",

Representative plots showing the average methylation spanning a 10 kb region at the 5′ end of the TNF, IL12A, TLR2, NFKB2, DTX4, C1QB and NOS2 genes. The red and blue lines represent average methylation levels for infected and control samples, respectively.",

Methylation was not different at any of the loci tested (paired t-test P ≥ 0.05) between M. bovis-infected and non-infected control bAM. The number of CpG dinucleotides analysed at each loci were TNF (9 CpGs), IL12A (11 CpGs), TLR2 (9 CpGs), NFKB2 (8 CpGs), C1QB (4 CpGs), DTX4 (3 CpGs) and NOS2 (1 CpG).",
  "figure_6": "Analysis of promoters with highly methylated and unmethylated sequence. 1,034 proximal promoters, with a minimum of 30 CpGs, shown to be intermediately methylated (IM) in the WGBS analysis were visually inspected to remove false positives. 767 were eliminated from the IM group due to averaging of highly methylated and unmethylated CpGs in the proximal promoter region (green dashed box). Four examples are presented here: the GUCY2D, SYN1, RRP1B and FOXRED2 genes. Red and blue lines represent average methylation levels for infected and control samples, respectively.",

Green dashed boxes illustrate the C1QB and IL2RA proximal promoter regions (the TSS minus 1.5 kb, plus 500 bp) identified as intermediately methylated (IM) during WGBS data analysis (average methylation 33–66%).
