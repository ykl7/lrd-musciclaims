Purity of the cells was confirmed using flow cytometry with anti-CD14. Isolated cells were washed and seeded for 24 h prior to infection. Infected bAM were exposed to M. bovis at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 10:1 for 2 h. After 2 h the media was replaced in control and infected samples and cells were harvested after 24 h for analysis of DNA methylation.
