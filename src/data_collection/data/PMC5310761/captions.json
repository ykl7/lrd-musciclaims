  "figure_1": "An individual trajectory is composed of pauses (red dots) and displacements (dashed black line). The trajectory shows the positions of one individual across 26 hours. Location is estimated from individual’s WiFi scans as detailed in the text and the data is sampled in 1 min bins. Red dots correspond to locations where the individual spent more than 10 consecutive minutes. The coordinates of these locations have been slightly altered to protect the subject privacy. The map was generated with the Matplotlib Basemap toolkit for Python (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/basemap). Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors (License: http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).

  "figure_2": "Blue dotted line: data. Black dashed line: log-normal fit with characteristic parameter μ and σ. Red dashed line: Pareto fit with characteristic parameter β for Δr > 7420 m.",
  "figure_3": "A) Frequency histogram of 96.2% of individuals for which the individual distribution of displacement is log-normal, according to the value of the log-normal fit coefficient μ. B-C-D) Examples of the distribution of displacements P(Δr) of three individuals i1 (B), i2 (C), i3 (D) (dotted line), with the corresponding log-normal fit (dashed line). The value of the fit coefficients μ and σ are reported in each subfigure.",

  "figure_5": "Green dotted line: data. Black dashed line: Log-normal fit with characteristic parameter μ and σ. Red dashed line: Pareto fit with characteristic parameter β for Δr > 2800 m.",
  "figure_6": "A) The duration Δtdisp of a displacement vs the distance Δr between origin and destination. The blue line is the median value of Δr and Δtdisp computed within log-spaced 2-dimensional bins. The filled blue area corresponds to the 25-75 percentile range. The value of the Pearson correlation coefficient within the shaded grey area indicates a positive correlation, with p − value < 0.01. The dashed line is a power-law function with coefficient β, as a guide for the eye. B) The waiting time Δt at destination vs the distance Δr between origin and destination. The blue line is the median value of Δr and Δt computed within log-spaced 2-dimensional bins. The filled blue area corresponds to the 25-75 percentile range. The value of the Pearson correlation coefficient within the shaded grey area indicates a positive correlation, with p − value < 0.01. The dashed line is a power-law function with coefficient β, as a guide for the eye."
