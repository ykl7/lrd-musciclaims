PMC5310761,"A trajectory consists of displacements between locations and pauses at locations, where the individual stops and spends time (Fig 1).",PMC5310761_figure_1,Fig 1. Example of an individual trajectory.,"An individual trajectory is composed of pauses (red dots) and displacements (dashed black line). The trajectory shows the positions of one individual across 26 hours. Location is estimated from individual’s WiFi scans as detailed in the text and the data is sampled in 1 min bins. Red dots correspond to locations where the individual spent more than 10 consecutive minutes. The coordinates of these locations have been slightly altered to protect the subject privacy.
