Fall risk defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STEADI initiative, Preventing Falls in Older Patients—A Provider Tool Kit.14 Number of falls defined as answer of “yes” to the question, “Have you fallen in the last 12 months?” in the succeeding four rounds of longitudinal data collection (2012–2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study). Answering “no” in all four subsequent rounds=0. Answering “yes” in at least one of the four subsequent rounds, ≥1. Bars denote 95% confidence intervals."
