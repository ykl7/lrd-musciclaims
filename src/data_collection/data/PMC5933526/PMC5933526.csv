PMC5933526,"When stratifying participants according to STEADI categorization and frailty status, greater STEADI fall risk predicted greater likelihood of falling, overall and within each level of frailty, but frailty status, although a significant predictor of falls alone, did not significantly improve prediction of subsequent falls within given levels of STEADI fall risk (Figure 2).",PMC5933526_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Predicted probability of falling over subsequent 4 years according to frailty status and Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths and Injuries (STEADI) initiative. Frailty status defined according to the Fried phenotypic model23 as: frail, ≥ 3 criteria, prefrail; 1–2 criteria; robust, 0 criteria. Fall risk defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STEADI initiative, Preventing Falls in Older Patients—A Provider Tool Kit.14 Number of falls defined as answer of “yes” to the question, “Have you fallen in the last 12 months?” in the succeeding four rounds of longitudinal data collection (2012–2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study). Answering “no” in all four subsequent rounds=0. Answering “yes” in at least one of the four subsequent rounds, ≥1.
