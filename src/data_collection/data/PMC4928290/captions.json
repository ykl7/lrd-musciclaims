  "figure_1": "Diagram of the IntA site-specific integration approach. a A novel region (the Landing Pad or LP sector) was inserted into the chromosome of R. etli. This region comprises a new attA region, flanked by a lac promoter and a promoterless green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene; and a spectinomycin resistance gene with its own promoter. b Mobilizable kanamycin-resistant donor vector (pK18 mob att Δplac) containing an attD site and a Multi Cloning site (MCS). The plac promoter was removed from the donor vector as described in Methods. c Predicted structure of integrants of pK18 mob att Δplac into the LP sector. Note that integration of the donor vector by attA X attD recombination abolishes transcription of the GFP gene, leading to nonfluorescent colonies. In panels a and c, the location of oligonucleotide primers useful to verify insertion, are indicated as arrows below the appropriate locations",
  "figure_2": "Characterization of the R. etli LP strain (557). a Visualization of selected strains under white light (top) and UV light (bottom). Strains, in a clockwise order were: E. coli harboring plasmid pRG11 (Landing Pad); R. etli wild type (CE3); R. etli 557 (LP strain). b PCR reactions verifying that integration occurred in the desired chromosomal site. Lanes 2 and 4 are PCR reactions with primers chr_left_out and Plac-out, while lanes 3 and 5 contain PCR reactions with primers CasNot-Ter-out and chr_right_out. The strains analyzed are indicated in the top of the panel. c Plasmid profile of the same strains analyzed in (a) and (b)",
  "figure_3": "Isolation of integrants. Visualization of random integrants resulting from integration of pK18 mob att Δplac into R. etli 557. Note the presence of a relatively high frequency of nonfluorescent colonies, indicating integration of pK18 mob att Δplac into the LP sector",
  "figure_4": "Analyses of selected cointegrates. All panels: lanes or blocks marked 1 correspond to a nonfluorescent kanamycin resistant cointegrate, while lanes or blocks 2 and 3 correspond to different fluorescent kanamycin resistant cointegrates. a Plasmid profiles of selected strains, stained with ethidium bromide. Plasmid identification is depicted at the left of the panel. b Southern blots of the corresponding plasmid profile, revealed by autoradiography, using 32P-labelled pK18mob as probe. Chr, chromosome. c PCR products of three different strains with a set of primers that distinguish among insertions for the LP sector in the chromosome (lanes c, primers ChrleftD and ChrightD), or pRetCFN42a (lanes a, primers LwattA1 and M13 reverse) and pRetCFN42d (lanes d, primers LwattD1 and M13 reverse)",
  "figure_5": "Flow cytometry analyses. For each sample, data from a minimum of 107 cells serially subcultured in the absence of antibiotics, for a period representing 21 generations were collected using ImageStream X imaging flow cytometer and analyzed using IDEAS 5.0 software. a cells with insertion of the LP sector on the chromosome display strong fluorescence. b cells with pK18 mob att Δplac inserted in the LP sector. c Mixture of cells corresponding to integration of pK18 mob att Δplac in the LP sector (107 cells) and the strain harboring the LP sector (103 cells)",
  "figure_6": "Integrants on the LP sector may acquire additional sequences. a Structure of integrants carrying pK18 mob att Δplac in the LP sector. Note that integration generates a duplication of att sequences. b Mobilizable gentamicin resistant donor vector (pG18 mob att) containing an attA site, a plac promoter and a Multi Cloning site (MCS). c Predicted structure of integrants of pG18 mob att into the integrant shown in (a). Notice that integration of the donor vector into the rightmost att sequence places a plac promoter in proximity to the GFP gene. d Specific PCR assays demonstrating the occurrence of additional insertions within the LP sector. Control strain 557 (lanes 1 and 2); five strains with additional insertions, arranged in pairs (lanes 3 to 12). Lanes with odd numbers correspond to amplification with a set of primers revealing integration on the left att sequence (ChrleftD-G18lw) and even numbers correspond to amplification with primers complementary to the right side (ChrightD-G18up), of the LP sector. Note that most of the strains harbor additional insertions on the rightmost att site, while the strain depicted in lanes 3 and 4 carry insertions on both the left and the right att sites"
