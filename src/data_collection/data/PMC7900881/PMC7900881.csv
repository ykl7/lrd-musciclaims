PMC7900881,"Eighteen different medications showed statistically significant associations with refractive error after adjustment for multiple testing (Table, Fig. 1).",PMC7900881_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Circular bar plot showing the associations between refractive error and 18 different medications. Colored
bars represent the LMM betas, and gray
bars show the P values of the associations. The values refer to the difference in spherical equivalent between the group of subjects under the specific medication and the control group (rest of the cohort that does not report taking that same medication).",./data/PMC7900881/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1f7a/7900881/1308d8e095a8/iovs-62-2-15-f001.jpg
PMC7900881,"The associations between IOP-lowering medication and SpE were driven by participants who reported spectacle correction earlier in life (AOSW< 35 years) (Table), particularly in the first two decades (Fig. 2), well before the age in which these medications are typically prescribed.",PMC7900881_figure_2,Figure 2.,"The differences in spherical equivalent between subjects receiving IOP-lowering medication and subjects who were not receiving them, by age of first spectacle wear. The AOSW shown on the x-axis is the first year of each of the 5-year periods in which the individuals started correcting their refractive error (e.g., 0–5, 5–10), and the y-axis denotes the adjusted difference in spherical equivalent observed in each group. The medications are specified in the figure legend, where a symbol to the left of a medication name denotes results that are not statistically significant (see Methods), and a solid symbol to the right indicates a statistically significant difference.",./data/PMC7900881/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1f7a/7900881/30322bf70327/iovs-62-2-15-f002.jpg
PMC7900881,"These associations were particularly significant among individuals who started refractive correction after the fourth decade of life (Fig. 3), but because we lacked suitable instrumental variables (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] significantly associated with their intake in addition to the diseases they are indicated for) we were unable to draw firm conclusions about the direction of causality.",PMC7900881_figure_3,Figure 3.,"The differences in spherical equivalent between subjects receiving antihyperglycemic, anti-uricemic or ipratropium medication and subjects who were not receiving them, by age of first spectacle wear.
