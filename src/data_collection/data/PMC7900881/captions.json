  "figure_1": "Circular bar plot showing the associations between refractive error and 18 different medications. Colored\nbars represent the LMM betas, and gray\nbars show the P values of the associations. The values refer to the difference in spherical equivalent between the group of subjects under the specific medication and the control group (rest of the cohort that does not report taking that same medication).",
  "figure_2": "The differences in spherical equivalent between subjects receiving IOP-lowering medication and subjects who were not receiving them, by age of first spectacle wear. The AOSW shown on the x-axis is the first year of each of the 5-year periods in which the individuals started correcting their refractive error (e.g., 0–5, 5–10), and the y-axis denotes the adjusted difference in spherical equivalent observed in each group. The medications are specified in the figure legend, where a symbol to the left of a medication name denotes results that are not statistically significant (see Methods), and a solid symbol to the right indicates a statistically significant difference.",
  "figure_3": "The differences in spherical equivalent between subjects receiving antihyperglycemic, anti-uricemic or ipratropium medication and subjects who were not receiving them, by age of first spectacle wear. The AOSW shown on the x-axis is the first year of each of the 5-year periods in which the individuals started correcting their refractive error (e.g., 0–5, 5–10), and the y-axis denotes the adjusted difference in spherical equivalent observed in each group.
