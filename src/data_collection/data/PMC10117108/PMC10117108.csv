Normalized change in skills was lowest for the students with the highest presemester skills scores (quartile 4); however, normalized change in skills did not significantly vary across the four quartiles of presemester scores (Welch’s analysis of variance [ANOVA], P = 0.134) (Fig. 3A).",PMC10117108_figure_3,FIG 3.,(A) Distribution of normalized change in skills and attitudes scores (mean ± SD) based on presemester survey scores.
