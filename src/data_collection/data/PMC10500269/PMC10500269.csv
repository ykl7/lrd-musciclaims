PMC10500269,"For example, during the winter months cats search for heat sources, preferring to sleep near sources of heat (see Figure 2a) (including solar radiation), to rest on insulating material or in contact with their conspecifics or owners, and to assume curled up positions.",PMC10500269_figure_2,Figure 2.,Images of cats expressing thermal behaviours: (a) Cat seeking heat source during cold season; and at dissipating heat through conduction with cold floors during hot seasons (b) (© M.
