  "figure_1": "A) On each trial, participants responded to the dominant color in a bivalent random dot kinematogram. This stimulus had a random color (target) coherence, depending on the proportion of dots that were in the majority. This stimulus also had a random motion (distractor) congruence, depending on motion coherence in the same or opposite direction as the color response. B) Across trials, we parametrically and independently varied the coherence of the dominant color (y-axis) and the congruence of the motion direction (x-axis). C) In Experiments 1 and 2, participants alternated between longer blocks of Attend-Color trials (target dimension was color, as in A) and shorter blocks of Attend-Motion trials (target dimension was motion). Participants took a self-timed break between blocks. D) In Experiment 3, participants alternated between pairs of Reward blocks and No Reward blocks. On Reward blocks, participants could earn a monetary bonus if they were fast and accurate, whereas we just encourage good performance on No Reward blocks. Participants were informed of the reward condition during their break between blocks.",
  "figure_6": "A) The relationship between target coherence and accuracy increased at later RTs (pinker color). B) Participants responded faster on error trials that correct trial when target coherence was higher. C) Regression estimates for the interaction between target coherence and RT (blue) and accuracy (red), within each experiment. D) The relationship between distractor congruence and accuracy decreased at later RTs (pinker). Note that these data are mean-centered within each RT bin to remove the target effects in (A) from this visualization of distractor sensitivity. E) Participants responded faster on error trials than correct trials when distractors were incongruent. F) Regression estimates for the interaction between distractor congruence and RT (blue) and accuracy (red), within each experiment. G) Target (green) and distractor (cyan) sensitivity plotted as a function of reaction time, as estimated by our regression model in Attend-Color blocks. Vertical lines indicate quartiles of the RT distribution. H) Same as G, but generated from regression models fit to the Attend-Motion blocks. Note the different scaling of the x-axis and y-axis (see dashed line between plots). Error bars on behavior reflect within-participant SEM, error bars on sensitivity estimates reflect between-participant SEM of the predictions, error bars on regression coefficients reflect 95% CI. Psychometric functions are jittered on the x-axis for ease of visualization. Feature coherence and RT were rank-ordered and binned into quantiles with equal numbers of trials at each level of target coherence, distractor congruence, or RT bin.",
  "figure_7": "A) The relationship between previous distractor congruence and current distractor congruence was strongest for early RTs (bluer color). The y-axis depicts the difference in accuracy between the extreme tertiles of previous congruence, for visualization purposes. B) Target (green) and distractor (cyan) sensitivity plotted as a function of previous congruence (color shade) and reaction time (x-axis), as estimated by our regression model. Vertical lines indicate quartiles of the RT distribution. C) Regression estimates for the interactions between reaction time and previous congruence on lapse rate (‘Saturation Dynamics’, orange); or reaction time, previous congruence, and feature coherence on accuracy (target is green, distractor is cyan). D) The relationship between incentives and target coherence was strongest for early RTs (bluer color). The y-axis depicts the difference in accuracy between blocks where there were rewards vs blocks without rewards. E) Target (green) and distractor (cyan) sensitivity plotted as a function of incentives (gold) and reaction time (x-axis), as estimated by our regression model. Vertical lines indicate quartiles of the RT distribution. F) Regression estimates for the interactions between reaction time and incentives on lapse rate (orange); or reaction time, incentives, and feature coherence on accuracy (target is green, distractor is cyan). Error bars on behavior reflect within-participant SEM, error bars on sensitivity estimates reflect between-participant SEM on the predictions, error bars on regression coefficients reflect 95% CI.

  "figure_8": "Color evidence (green) and motion evidence (blue) are transformed and accumulated to make a choice. Balanced excitatory connections (black solid lines) and inhibitory connections (red dashed lines) cause accumulation of the difference in evidence for each response. A) Evidence for the left response (purple) and right response (orange) are accumulated over time without leak. When one of the accumulators crosses a (linearly collapsing) decision threshold, the model chooses that response. B) Within each trial, the signal-to-noise of each feature pathways is controlled by a feature gain. Over time within a trial, the feature gains for targets (green) and distractors (cyan) exponentially approach to a fixed level (high gain for targets, zero gain for distractors). Note the difference in x-axis scaling compared to Figure 6G. C) An equivalent visualization of the dynamics in B. Attractor dynamics drive target and distractor gains to their fixed level, shown at different timepoints within the trial (pinker colors are later in the trial). The horizontal line depicts zero distractor gain.",

B) Regression estimates for the effect of target coherence on performance within each experiment, plotted for accuracy (blue, left axis) and RT (red, right axis).
