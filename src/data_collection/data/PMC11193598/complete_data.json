      "caption": "A) On each trial, participants responded to the dominant color in a bivalent random dot kinematogram. This stimulus had a random color (target) coherence, depending on the proportion of dots that were in the majority. This stimulus also had a random motion (distractor) congruence, depending on motion coherence in the same or opposite direction as the color response. B) Across trials, we parametrically and independently varied the coherence of the dominant color (y-axis) and the congruence of the motion direction (x-axis). C) In Experiments 1 and 2, participants alternated between longer blocks of Attend-Color trials (target dimension was color, as in A) and shorter blocks of Attend-Motion trials (target dimension was motion). Participants took a self-timed break between blocks. D) In Experiment 3, participants alternated between pairs of Reward blocks and No Reward blocks. On Reward blocks, participants could earn a monetary bonus if they were fast and accurate, whereas we just encourage good performance on No Reward blocks. Participants were informed of the reward condition during their break between blocks.",
