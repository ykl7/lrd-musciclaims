PMC11193598,"To provide a bridge between our regression analyses and processes models of decision-making, we adopted a generative modeling approach and tested whether participant behavior could be reproduced by a sequential sampling model (Figure 8).",PMC11193598_figure_8,Figure 8. Feedforward inhibition with control.,"Color evidence (green) and motion evidence (blue) are transformed and accumulated to make a choice. Balanced excitatory connections (black solid lines) and inhibitory connections (red dashed lines) cause accumulation of the difference in evidence for each response. A) Evidence for the left response (purple) and right response (orange) are accumulated over time without leak. When one of the accumulators crosses a (linearly collapsing) decision threshold, the model chooses that response. B) Within each trial, the signal-to-noise of each feature pathways is controlled by a feature gain. Over time within a trial, the feature gains for targets (green) and distractors (cyan) exponentially approach to a fixed level (high gain for targets, zero gain for distractors).

PMC11193598,"Results
Participants performed the Parametric Attentional Control Task (PACT), a perceptual discrimination task that required them to classify the dominant color in an array of moving dots (Figure 1a).",PMC11193598_figure_1,Figure 1. Parametric Attentional Control Task (PACT).,"A) On each trial, participants responded to the dominant color in a bivalent random dot kinematogram. This stimulus had a random color (target) coherence, depending on the proportion of dots that were in the majority. This stimulus also had a random motion (distractor) congruence, depending on motion coherence in the same or opposite direction as the color response. B) Across trials, we parametrically and independently varied the coherence of the dominant color (y-axis) and the congruence of the motion direction (x-axis). C) In Experiments 1 and 2, participants alternated between longer blocks of Attend-Color trials (target dimension was color, as in A) and shorter blocks of Attend-Motion trials (target dimension was motion). Participants took a self-timed break between blocks. D) In Experiment 3, participants alternated between pairs of Reward blocks and No Reward blocks. On Reward blocks, participants could earn a monetary bonus if they were fast and accurate, whereas we just encourage good performance on No Reward blocks. Participants were informed of the reward condition during their break between blocks.",./data/PMC11193598/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a00e/11193598/ed148211c1ad/nihms-1936943-f0001.jpg

PMC11193598,"When varying both target and distractor features (Experiments 2–3), we found an additional influence of previous distractor congruence on target processing, whereby more incongruent previous trials enhanced the influence of target discriminability on the current trial (Figure 3d–e).",PMC11193598_figure_3,Figure 3. Distractor-dependent adaptation.,"A-B) The relationship between distractor congruence and accuracy (A) and RT (B) was weaker when the previous trial was more incongruent (redder colors). Circles depict participant behavior and lines depict aggregated regression predictions. C) Regression estimates for the current distractor congruence by previous distractor congruence interaction, within each experiment. D-E) The relationship between target coherence and performance was stronger after more incongruent trials in accuracy (D) but not RT (E). F) Regression estimates for the current target coherence by previous distractor congruence interaction, within each experiment. Error bars on behavior reflect within-participant SEM, error bars on regression coefficients reflect 95% CI. Psychometric functions are jittered on the x-axis for ease of visualization.
