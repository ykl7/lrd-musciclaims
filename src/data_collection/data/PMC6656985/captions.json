  "figure_1": "Experiment Timeline. Prior to imaging, BUN levels were measured (t = 0). Short term bioeffect assessments were quantified 24 hours after imaging. Blood and kidneys were collected for BUN and histopathology analysis. Long term bioeffect assessments were quantified 2 weeks post imaging. This timeline was followed for animals exposed to 1.0 MI and 1.9 MI microbubble destructive pulses. This figure was made in likeness of Fig. 1 of Nyankima et al. [1] and captures the difference in time points assessed.",
  "figure_2": "Histopathology Results. Histopathologic kidney examination for RBCs after both moderate and high destructive pulses at 24 hours and 2 weeks. Data is displayed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). This figure was made in likeness of Figure 4 of Nyankima et al. [1].",
  "figure_3": "Clinical Chemistry Results. BUN levels are grouped by imaging parameters and endpoint. Results of paired T-test indicate a statistically significant increase in BUN levels for subjects in the high MI group after 2 weeks (p-value from 0.001 to 0.01 is marked with a ‘**’). No statistical significance was observed in the low MI groups. Average BUN values remained within normal range for female Fischer rat (15–24 mg/dL, dashed lines)."
