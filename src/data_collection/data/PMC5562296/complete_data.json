In this example, a tab-delimited text file containing operational taxonomic units (OTUs, which can be considered molecular “species”) is visualized as colored circles in a bubble chart in the Phinch framework [3], with circle size correlated to abundance. (2) Step 2: Clicking on a specific data point (e.g., an OTU) will pull up any online information associated with that species ID or taxonomic group, such as Wikipedia entries, photos, DNA sequences, peer-reviewed articles, and geolocated species observations displayed on a map.
