The Panel notes that the studies selected were heterogeneous with respect to the length of follow‐up, the methods and criteria used for the assessment of (health) outcomes, the study design, the way in which the exposure was assessed (i.e. the timing of introduction of CFs), the classification into exposure groups, the study settings and the populations investigated (Figure 2).",PMC7009265_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Characteristics of the included human studies (body of evidence) from the systematic literature search
