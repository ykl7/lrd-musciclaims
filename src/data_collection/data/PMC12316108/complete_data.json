For the 4 largest disciplinary categories—engineering, the formal sciences, the natural sciences, and social sciences—the survey listed examples of specific disciplines within that category as follows: engineering (eg, civil, environmental, geotechnical, mechanical), formal Sciences (eg, computer science, mathematics, statistics), and the social sciences (eg, anthropology, geography, political science, psychology, sociology, urban planning, etc.). bIn Panel 2, interdisciplinary teams are defined as having members from at least 2 of the 7 academic backgrounds listed in the Panel 1.
