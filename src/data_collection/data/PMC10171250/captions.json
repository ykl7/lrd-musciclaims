  "figure_1": "Two-way interaction between trait-FoMO (FoMO) and FoMO Cue on reported alcohol craving for non-imputed data. B-weights represent simple slopes for given conditions, with means and standard deviations per condition subsequently noted. Gray shading around lines denotes 95% confidence intervals. Small shapes denote individual participant values for reported Alcohol Craving Index.",
  "figure_2": "Associations of FoMO and alcohol cue presence on reported drinking likelihood. Large shapes denote group means; bars denote 95% confidence intervals. Small shapes denote individual participant values for reported drinking likelihood. Individual points were “jittered” (i.e., a small amount for random space added) to adjust for overplotting of discrete values on the drinking likelihood scale."
