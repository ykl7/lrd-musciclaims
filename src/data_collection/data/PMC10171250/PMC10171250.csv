PMC10171250,"Alcohol craving (Table 5, Figure 1).",PMC10171250_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Two-way interaction between trait-FoMO (FoMO) and FoMO Cue on reported alcohol craving for non-imputed data. B-weights represent simple slopes for given conditions, with means and standard deviations per condition subsequently noted. Gray shading around lines denotes 95% confidence intervals. Small shapes denote individual participant values for reported Alcohol Craving Index.",./data/PMC10171250/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44ce/10171250/fdaeb0b91eb1/jsad.22-00079fig1.jpg
PMC10171250,"Drinking likelihood (Table 6, Figure 2).",PMC10171250_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Associations of FoMO and alcohol cue presence on reported drinking likelihood. Large shapes denote group means; bars denote 95% confidence intervals. Small shapes denote individual participant values for reported drinking likelihood. Individual points were “jittered” (i.e., a small amount for random space added) to adjust for overplotting of discrete values on the drinking likelihood scale.",./data/PMC10171250/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44ce/10171250/7a66d2ee65e2/jsad.22-00079fig2.jpg
