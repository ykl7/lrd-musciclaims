PMC11253758,"LTC is facing high rates of age-related chronic disease and pressure to maximise value.2 As a highly controlled residential institution,3 LTC is also held responsible for maintaining resident quality of life by providing person-centred care and supporting physical and psychological health.2 Quality of life overlaps conceptually with health-related quality of life, subjective well-being and social care-related quality of life.1 4 5 It is also a broad term, incorporating subjective, objective, personal and organisational elements.4 Therefore, it is unsurprising that quality of life is understood differently by different players in the LTC system6 and can be easily oversimplified or equated to happiness, quality of care or satisfaction.1
Figure 1 shows a concept map describing the multiple dimensions of quality of life.1
