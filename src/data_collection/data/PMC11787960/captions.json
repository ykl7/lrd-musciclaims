  "figure_2": "Relationship between controllable factors and COVID‐19 infection probability. (A) (a) Changes in infection probability under poor ventilation and lack of vaccination; (b) changes in infection probability under medium ventilation and lack of vaccination; (c) changes in infection probability under well ventilation and lack of vaccination. (B) (a) Changes in infection probability under poor ventilation and vaccination; (b) changes in infection probability under medium ventilation and vaccination; (c) changes in infection probability under well ventilation and vaccination. Note: Assumed a vaccine protection rate of 53.17%; place volume was 300 m3; type of mask was a medical surgical mask. Ventilation considered three situations: poorly ventilated (ACH = 0.5), medium ventilated (ACH = 3), and well ventilated (ACH = 10). The maximum exposure time was 24 h; the distance was 1 m. Part (A) was unvaccinated, and part (B) was vaccinated."
