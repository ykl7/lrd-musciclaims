PMC11787960,"Using Figure 2A(a) as a reference, in the case of poorly ventilated, unvaccinated (or without previous infection), without wearing a mask and exposure for 3 h, the probability of infection in the combination of four activity levels and breathing types was 92.97%, 60.2%, 30.39%, and 8.04%, respectively, which indicated that, in the place of light activity and speaking/singing loudly, the probability of infection for contacts was as high as 90%, significantly higher than the probabilities associated with other combinations of activity levels and breathing types.",PMC11787960_figure_2,FIGURE 2.,"Relationship between controllable factors and COVID‐19 infection probability.
