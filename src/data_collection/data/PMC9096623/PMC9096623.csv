PMC9096623,"This pattern of results remained virtually identical when analyses were limited to healthy (neurotypical) samples, although effect sizes were somewhat larger in this subgroup ranging from r = 0.19 to 0.24 for the Hedges & Olkin, 0.23 to 0.29 for the Hunter & Schmidt, and 0.20 to 0.24 for the RVE method (left side of table 2; figure 2 for a forest plot of the Hedges & Olkin analysis).",PMC9096623_figure_2,Figure 2.,Forest plot of healthy samples (Hedges & Olkin model).,./data/PMC9096623/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3e8a/9096623/9465d89db438/rsos211621f02.jpg
PMC9096623,"Patient samples also showed non-trivial small-to-moderate effects, although they were slightly weaker than those of healthy samples (excepting Hedges & Olkin, as well as RVE analyses for verbal IQ; right part of table 2; figure 3 for a forest plot of the Hedges & Olkin-typed analysis).",PMC9096623_figure_3,Figure 3.,Forest plot of patient samples (Hedges & Olkin model).,./data/PMC9096623/images/figure_3.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3e8a/9096623/ecf247786bff/rsos211621f03.jpg

PMC9096623,"Finally, visual inspections of cumulative forest plots of full-scale IQ associations show a clear pattern of systematically decreasing effect sizes over time, thus conforming to our findings of significant negative influences of study years on effect sizes (figure 5).",PMC9096623_figure_5,Figure 5.,Cumulative forest plot of healthy sample effects according to publication year for full-scale IQ.,./data/PMC9096623/images/figure_5.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3e8a/9096623/dc19f0b94141/rsos211621f05.jpg
PMC9096623,"When cumulating results according to sample sizes, a less unequivocal picture emerged, although larger samples appeared to show weaker effects than smaller samples, thus conforming to the above evidence that suggests the presence of some confounding bias in the present data (figure 6).",PMC9096623_figure_6,Figure 6.,Cumulative forest plot of healthy sample effects according to sample size for full-scale IQ.,./data/PMC9096623/images/figure_6.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3e8a/9096623/3d1bd9d8fd7d/rsos211621f06.jpg
