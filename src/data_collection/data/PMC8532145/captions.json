  "figure_1": "Overview of ADMIRE. (A) Obtain the time-delayed channel data and calculate the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) along the depth dimension for each channel. (B) Obtain the corresponding model matrix for each set of aperture domain frequency data that will be reconstructed in each STFT window in each beam, fit each model matrix to its corresponding set of aperture domain frequency data (sizes of red points correspond to how much each scattering location contributes to the aperture domain frequency data), and reconstruct each set of aperture domain frequency data by only using the predictors that correspond to scattering locations that are within a region of interest (ROI). (C) Calculate the inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT) of the reconstructed aperture domain frequency data in order to obtain the decluttered channel data. Note that the scattering locations are not restricted to the depth range of the STFT window. The grid of scattering locations illustrated in (B) corresponds to the first STFT window. For STFT windows that correspond to deeper depths, the scattering locations can also be located in shallower depths because these locations can contribute to off-axis scattering and multipath scattering that affect the aperture domain frequency data for the STFT window. Essentially, as the depths become deeper for subsequent STFT windows, the depth range for possible scattering locations also increases.",

  "figure_3": "Example of the cyclic coordinate descent optimization method. Each red point represents the objective function value at the end of a single iteration. The solid red lines represent minimizing the objective function with respect to one model coefficient at a time.",
  "figure_4": "(A) Example of an L1 cache memory access pattern where all of the threads within one warp require data that is located in one sector of memory, which means that only one memory transaction is required. In particular, the threads require the same memory address within the memory sector, which results in a broadcast operation. (B) Example of an L1 cache memory access pattern where the threads within one warp require data that is located in memory addresses that are not contiguous, which means that multiple memory transactions are required. Each cache line consists of 4 memory sectors that are each 32 bytes for a total of 128 bytes.",
  "figure_5": "Field II cyst simulation dataset with added white Gaussian noise processed with DAS using different GPU cases (left), ADMIRE using different GPU cases (center), and ADMIRE using a CPU (right). The power of the noise was scaled to be 0 dB relative to the power of the channel data. The average run times in seconds (N = 10 for CPU and N = 100 for GPU) are displayed at the top of the images along with the standard deviations, and the contrast ratio values in dB are displayed at the bottom. The cyst and background masks that were used for calculating the contrast ratio values are displayed as well.",
  "figure_6": "2080 Ti GPU processing times for individual stages of the GPU processing pipeline as a function of (A) the number of depth samples, (B) the number of elements per beam, and (C) the number of beams. When varying one parameter, the other parameters were held constant at their default values listed in Table I. Each stage has a corresponding subsection in the Methods section, and the CUDA kernels that are performed for a particular stage are the ones that are listed in its subsection. The color scheme for this figure was selected using [33].",
