(A) Obtain the time-delayed channel data and calculate the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) along the depth dimension for each channel. (B) Obtain the corresponding model matrix for each set of aperture domain frequency data that will be reconstructed in each STFT window in each beam, fit each model matrix to its corresponding set of aperture domain frequency data (sizes of red points correspond to how much each scattering location contributes to the aperture domain frequency data), and reconstruct each set of aperture domain frequency data by only using the predictors that correspond to scattering locations that are within a region of interest (ROI). (C) Calculate the inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT) of the reconstructed aperture domain frequency data in order to obtain the decluttered channel data. Note that the scattering locations are not restricted to the depth range of the STFT window. The grid of scattering locations illustrated in (B) corresponds to the first STFT window. For STFT windows that correspond to deeper depths, the scattering locations can also be located in shallower depths because these locations can contribute to off-axis scattering and multipath scattering that affect the aperture domain frequency data for the STFT window.
