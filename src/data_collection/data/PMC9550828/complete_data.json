In each trial, the participant is presented with an autobiographical narration that could vary on two dimensions (emotionality of the video: neutral vs. emotionally negative; ToM requirement: videos with and without ToM demand). After each video, participants rated their own affect (valence rating) and their compassion for the person in the video. This is followed by, a question either requiring mental state inference (for videos with ToM demand) or factual reasoning (for videos without ToM demand), and a prosociality rating (adapted from Kanske et al.33). Note that the exemplary images depicted in this figure are not based on the original video stimuli used in the EmpaToM task but, due to license restrictions, have been replaced with re-staged images showing (a meanwhile much younger version of) one of the authors.",
