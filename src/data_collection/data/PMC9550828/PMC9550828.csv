PMC9550828,Videos are followed by a valence rating (indicating empathic affect sharing) and by either a question regarding the narrators mental state (for videos with ToM demand) or a factual reasoning control question (for videos without ToM demand) (see Fig. 4).,PMC9550828_figure_4,Figure 4.,"EmpaToM trial sequence. In each trial, the participant is presented with an autobiographical narration that could vary on two dimensions (emotionality of the video: neutral vs. emotionally negative; ToM requirement: videos with and without ToM demand). After each video, participants rated their own affect (valence rating) and their compassion for the person in the video. This is followed by, a question either requiring mental state inference (for videos with ToM demand) or factual reasoning (for videos without ToM demand), and a prosociality rating (adapted from Kanske et al.33).

Employing a validated and naturalistic video-based assessment of empathy and mentalizing, we show that inducing empathy leads to a strong and reliable increase of prosocial decisions.",PMC9550828_figure_2,Figure 2.,"Scatter plots depicting interindividual differences.
