  "figure_4": "EmpaToM trial sequence. In each trial, the participant is presented with an autobiographical narration that could vary on two dimensions (emotionality of the video: neutral vs. emotionally negative; ToM requirement: videos with and without ToM demand). After each video, participants rated their own affect (valence rating) and their compassion for the person in the video. This is followed by, a question either requiring mental state inference (for videos with ToM demand) or factual reasoning (for videos without ToM demand), and a prosociality rating (adapted from Kanske et al.33). Note that the exemplary images depicted in this figure are not based on the original video stimuli used in the EmpaToM task but, due to license restrictions, have been replaced with re-staged images showing (a meanwhile much younger version of) one of the authors.",
  "figure_2": "Scatter plots depicting interindividual differences. Grey-shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals. (A) Relationship between valence ratings and prosocial decisions for the two video conditions (neutral vs. emotional), respectively. (B) Relationship between prosocial decisions and mean accuracy of the inference questions for the two question types (factual reasoning vs. mentalizing), respectively. rs: Spearman correlation coefficient, rt: Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient.",
  "figure_3": "Result of the intraindividual correlations between valence and prosocial decision. Small dots represent individual data points. Boxplot depicts the correlation median along with interquartile ranges, while the shaded area at the right of the mean shows a smoothed density distribution."
