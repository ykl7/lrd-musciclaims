Based on the mean value of SAS-SV scores in this population, the ordinate starts at 28. Highly gender conforming refers to male adolescents who reported very, mostly, and somewhat masculine or female adolescents who reported very, mostly, and somewhat feminine. Gender nonconforming refers to male adolescents who reported very, mostly, and somewhat feminine or female adolescents who reported very, mostly, and somewhat masculine. The mixed-effect linear regression model was adjusted for age, household socioeconomic status, family relationship, classmate relationship, teacher-classmate relationship, academic performance, and sexual orientation",
