PMC5870179,Figure 2 shows the improvement in predictive value of the GPAQ using the multiple linear regression models detailed in Table 4.,PMC5870179_figure_2,Fig. 2.,"Global Physical Activity Questionnaire Reported, Model-Adjusted, and ActiGraph Measured Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity. Triangles = raw GPAQ reported sedentary behavior and PA (min/d) plotted against ActiGraph measured sedentary behavior and PA (min/d)
Circles = model-adjusted sedentary behavior and PA (min/d) plotted against ActiGraph measured sedentary behavior and PA (min/d). Self-reported raw GPAQ values are connected to their corresponding model-adjusted GPAQ value with a horizontal line.
