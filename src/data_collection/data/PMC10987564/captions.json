  "figure_1": "The OMICS-LHV project used the systems biology paradigm to evaluate host responses to lethal virus infections. Samples were obtained from human or mouse cells and tissues infected with different viruses, host responses were measured using multi-omics approaches, and data were statistically processed using provided in-house developed software. From this, models of host responses may be used to develop hypotheses, which may be tested by perturbing the system and repeating the systems biology data analysis lifecycle.",
  "figure_2": "The OMICS-LHV project focused on Influenza A virus (IAV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Ebola virus (EBOV). The figure summarizes basic virology information covering pathogenic family, strains or subtypes used, virion type, genomic organization, replication site, disease type, and primary target cells and/or organs used in experimental designs. The virus strains used in the reported studies are provided, with additional details provided in the Methods and Supplementary Table 1.",
  "figure_3": "Model systems and timelines are summarized for multi-omics sample collection experiments in vitro and in vivo. For experimental design comparisons across the representative viral studies (IAV, MERS-CoV, WNV, and EBOVs), we have provided experimental conditions, including the cell or tissue type analysed, time points at which samples were obtained, and the omics data type collected. In all cell- or mouse-based model system experiments, transcriptomics analyses were done using mRNA or microRNA microarrays; while in the study of humans naturally infected with Ebola virus, transcriptomics analyses were done using RNA-Seq. ChIP-Seq and MeDIP-Seq experiments were carried out in Calu-3 cells (IAV) or Calu-3/2B4 cells (MERS-CoV) only. S1, S2, and S3 refer to blood sample 1, sample 2, and sample 3, respectively, collected from human patients infected with Ebola virus.",
  "figure_5": "The life cycle of all data generated in OMICs-LHV experiments is detailed. Experimental metadata, raw multi-omics data, and statistically processed datasets are available on PNNL DataHub.",
  "figure_6": "A basic overview of the statistical validation workflow is provided All raw multi-omics datasets were subjected to quality control analyses to remove outliers, eliminate features with low data, and normalize the data. Subsequently, statistical comparisons were made. Statistically processed datasets are available for each experiment in the data records on PNNL DataHub.",
  "figure_7": "Graphical overview of the OMICS-LHV multi-omics project collections and processed digital data downloads made available from PNNL DataHub. The PNNL DataHub OMICS-LHV project pages contain comprehensive data catalog information (left) and processed dataset package DOI downloads (right), linked to necessary context resource information supporting experimental and computational methods and relationships. EBOV, Ebola virus; IAV, influenza A virus; WNV, West Nile virus; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus; IFN, interferon."
