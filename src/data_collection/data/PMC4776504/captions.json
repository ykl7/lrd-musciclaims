  "figure_01": "Total wetland density (A–H, Upper) varies across the United States. We selected eight 1,000-km2 blocks (Lower, showing spatial subsets in A–H) to evaluate wetland resources (green) and other aquatic habitats (blue) to analyze landscape patterns of geographically isolated wetlands using data from the National Wetlands Inventory.",
  "figure_02": "Across blocks (A–H, maps in Fig. 1), the probability a wetland is geographically isolated declines with increasing wetland area (solid black lines). Small wetlands have higher perimeter-to-area ratios than larger wetlands (green dots) although large wetlands depart more from circular geometry (thick dashed black lines). The cumulative distribution of wetland perimeter (stippled gray lines) suggests that small wetlands provide a greater fraction of landscape total perimeter (ecotone) than total area (dashed gray lines), with implications for hydrologic, biogeochemical, and biological functions.",
  "figure_04": "(A) Hydrological connectivity between wetlands and downstream waters varies in space and time. Watershed travel time distributions are shortest for wetlands with persistent surface connectivity (green), intermediate (and bimodal) for wetlands with episodic surface connectivity (gold), and longest for wetlands without surface connections (red). Travel time distributions decline with increased watershed wetness. (B) Convolution of travel times means watershed exports are impacted by wetlands spanning the connectivity continuum. Differential protections across wetlands alter connectivity patterns and impact watershed functions and related ecosystem services."
