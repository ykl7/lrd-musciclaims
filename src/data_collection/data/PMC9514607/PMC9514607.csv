PMC9514607,Open science can and should be implemented at each step of the research process (Fig 1).,PMC9514607_figure_1,Fig 1. Using open science practices throughout translational research studies.,"Application of open science practices at each step of the research process can maximize the impact of performed animal experiments. The implementation of these practices will lead to less time pressure at the end of a project. Due to the connection of most of these open science practices, spending more time in the planning phase and during the conduction of experiments will save time during the data analysis and publication of the study. Indeed, consulting reporting guidelines early on, preregistering a statistical plan, and writing down crucial experimental details in an electronic lab notebook, will strongly accelerate the writing of a manuscript. If protocols or even electronic lab notebooks were made public, just citing these would simplify the writing of publications. Similarly, if a data management plan is well designed before starting data collection, analyzing, and depositing data in a public repository, as is increasingly required, will be fast.

PMC9514607,"Choosing the right license for the deposited code and data ensures that authors get credit for their work.Publication and connection of all outcomes
If scientists have used all available open science tools during the research process, then publishing and linking all outcomes represents the well-deserved harvest (Fig 2).",PMC9514607_figure_2,Fig 2. Published outcomes of classic versus open science projects.,"Application of open science practices can increase the reproducibility and visibility of a research project at the same time. By publishing different research outputs with more detailed information than can be included in a journal article, researchers enable peers to replicate their work. Reporting according to guidelines and using transparent visualization will further improve this reproducibility. The more research products that are generated, the more credit can be attributed. By communicating on social media or additionally publishing slides from delivered talks or posters, more attention can be raised.
