Each dot and the horizontal line through them correspond to the point estimate and confidence interval from each study respectively while the center and width of the diamond corresponds to the pooled estimate and its confidence interval respectively. Both within continent and overall pooled estimates are presented. Even though weighting (not shown) was done, it is not explicit because an iterative procedure was used in parameter estimation. ES indicates estimate.",

Each dot and the horizontal line through them correspond to the point estimate and confidence interval from each study respectively while the center and width of the diamond corresponds to the pooled estimate and its confidence interval respectively. Even though weighting (not shown) was done, it is not explicit because an iterative procedure was used in parameter estimation. All studies except one (Emura 2014, Colombia) were from Asia.

Each dot represents the R0 resection rate. Lack of asymmetry in the distribution of study estimates around the center of the funnel suggests no publication bias. P value for egger’s test = 0.57. ES, estimate; se(ES), standard error of estimate."
