  "figure_1": "Experimental induction of agentic states. Means and standard errors for subjective response to the i-BART risk task on days 1 (left) and 2 (right). Challenge = Incentive Balloon Analogue Risk Task (i-BART). PA = Positive Activation (exuberance). NA = Negative Activation (agentic anger). Pre-task PA in light gray, post-task PA in dark gray, induced exuberance in black (post-task PA minus pre-task PA). Pre-task NA in yellow, post-task NA in orange, induced anger in red (post-task NA minus pre-task NA). The i-BART significantly increased anger (Negative Activation, NA) and exuberance (Positive Activation, PA) on both study days (p < 0.001). Rise in induced exuberance did not differ by day (n.s.). Rise in induced anger was larger on day 2 than day 1, evidence of behavioral sensitization (p < 0.001). Note, bars for Induced exuberance and Induced anger represent within-subject difference scores, calculated based on levels of a factor evaluated in the ANOVA (see methods). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, N = 39 healthy volunteers, Study 1.",
  "figure_4": "Boxcar design, fMRI iBART task. (A) The fMRI i-BART was presented in a boxcar design in four runs. Each run was 262.5 s (4.37 m.) in duration and contained three task blocks of 64 s duration apiece [low stakes (LS), medium stakes (MS), and high stakes (HS)], separated by two sensorimotor control blocks (0 cents/pump) of 32 s duration apiece. Total acquisition time was 17.5 min of functional imaging per session. Y-axis indicates incentive value of each block (cents per pump). L = low stakes (0.05 cents/pump), M = medium stakes (1 cent/pump), H = high stakes (5 cents/pump), c = sensorimotor control blocks (0 cents/pump). Values on y-axis are not to scale. (B) Example of computer screen presented to participants during performance of trials from (left to right): sensorimotor control blocks, low stakes blocks, medium stakes blocks, and high stakes blocks. Images in yellow, green, blue and red outline as in panel (A). Note all trials of the task used a gray-only background; color corresponds to condition in panel (A). N = 10, Study 2.",

Proposed contributions of catecholamines to agentic states. a Denotes direct effects of CA on agentic emotion. b Denotes CA modulation of perception, processing and reactivity to incentive cues. c Denotes subsequent effects on agentic states. + Denotes positive association within-persons.
