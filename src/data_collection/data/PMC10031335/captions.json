  "figure_2": "Meta-analysis of total HRQOL scores according to QOL assessment instruments. Higher scores indicate better HRQOL (range, 0 to 100). To match the amplitude and effect direction of most instruments, EQ-5D-3L scores are presented as 100 times the original figures and Haemo-QoL scores are presented as 100 minus the original scores because, originally, higher scores indicated worse QOL in the Haemo-QoL questionnaire. All other scores are presented on the original scale of each specific instrument. TE, treatment effect; seTE, standard error for treatment effect; HRQoL, health-related quality of life; CI, confidence interval."
