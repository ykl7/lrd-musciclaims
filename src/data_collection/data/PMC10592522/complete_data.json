The random effects model contained random effects for therapist and an intercept. The base model included patient case-mix variables and type of trauma focused psychotherapy. (B) Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the fixed effects for therapist-level predictors from multilevel models for dropout. The left panel B presents fixed effects with each predictor added individually to the base model. The right panel B presents fixed effects with session spacing intensity, adherence, implementation climate scores and caseload added simultaneously to the base model.",
