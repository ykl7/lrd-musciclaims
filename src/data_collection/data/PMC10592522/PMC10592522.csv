PMC10592522,"Bold indicates statistically significant effects.Figure 1A presents the TEs without case-mix adjustment (random effects), with adjustment for case mix and TFP type (base model) and when each therapist-level factor was added to the base model; Figure 1B shows the corresponding adjusted odds ratios for each predictor.",PMC10592522_figure_1,Figure 1.,"(A) Estimates for therapist effect variances in multilevel logistic regression models for dropout with the addition of the predictors listed on the Y-axis. The random effects model contained random effects for therapist and an intercept. The base model included patient case-mix variables and type of trauma focused psychotherapy. (B) Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the fixed effects for therapist-level predictors from multilevel models for dropout. The left panel B presents fixed effects with each predictor added individually to the base model. The right panel B presents fixed effects with session spacing intensity, adherence, implementation climate scores and caseload added simultaneously to the base model.",./data/PMC10592522/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/deb8/10592522/0ddf422a5138/nihms-1909019-f0001.jpg
