PMC11789980,"Critically, due to the nature of the CO2 capture mechanism, the system can operate in very humid conditions, which is a considerable hurdle for many temperature‐swing DAC systems.

PMC11789980,"Coulombic efficiency was calculated for each cycle based on the amount of charge passed during the charge cycle (sorption) divided by the amount of charged passed during the discharge cycle (desorption).
[26]
 Alternatively, capacity retention is defined as the amount of charge passed on the discharge cycle of cycle n relative to the amount of charge passed on the discharge cycle of n+1.
