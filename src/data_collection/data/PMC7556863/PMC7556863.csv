PMC7556863,"The time taken for acronyms to be re-used has also increased over time (Figure 2), indicating that acronyms created today are less likely to be re-used than previously created acronyms.",PMC7556863_figure_2,Figure 2. Estimated time to re-use of acronyms over time.,"The solid line is the estimated time in years for 10% of newly coined acronyms to be re-used in the same journal. 10% was chosen based on the overall percentage of acronyms being re-used within a year. Newly coined acronyms are grouped by year. The dotted lines show the 95% confidence interval for the time to re-use, which narrows over time as the sample size increases. The general trend is of an increasing time to re-use from 1965 onwards, which indicates that acronyms are being re-used less often. The relatively slow times to re-use in the 1950s and early 1960s are likely due to the very different mix of journals in that time.",./data/PMC7556863/images/figure_2.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4e84/7556863/0848ce299888/elife-60080-fig2.jpg
