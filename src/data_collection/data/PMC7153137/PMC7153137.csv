PMC7153137,"The architecture, seen in Figure 1, consists of four main components: text processing using various processing resources (PRs) operating within the open-source General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) [7]; converting the GATE output to a syntactic KB consisting of propositions in a first order logic; aligning terms in the KB with background knowledge and importing relevant data; and mapping syntactic relations to semantic relations using both domain-neutral and domain-specific mapping rules informed by the background knowledge.1
