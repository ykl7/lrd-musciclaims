  "figure_1": "Simplified overview of Pre2Pub’s working mechanism. The input is the metadata of a preprint. Then, by querying the PubMed application programming interface, a title search is performed. If this is successful, the authors are compared by our 5-step method. If not, we perform an author search directly in PubMed and compare then the titles. For the matching articles, the dates are checked and the pairwise abstract similarity is determined. Finally, the article with the highest similarity is returned—if it exceeds the threshold of 0.9.",
  "figure_2": "Growth of preprint publications. Combined data include data from both bioRxiv and medRxiv. The blue line comprises all available data, and the green line indicates the amount of preprints minus COVID-19–related papers. Only the medRxiv proportion is depicted as a bar diagram, thereby distinguishing COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 articles.",
  "figure_3": "Overview of found journal articles in different sources and through different methods. In the 6 plots, the first bar indicates the total amount of preprints deposited in the preprint servers. Afterward, the absolute amount of found peer-reviewed publications is indicated for all three methods investigated: via the preprint server application programming interface itself, via Crossref, and via Pre2Pub. DOI: digital object identifier.",
  "figure_4": "Amount and intersection of found journal articles for 3 different methods. For the combined data set from bioRxiv and medRxiv for 2019, 2020, and 2021, the amount of journal articles is shown for each method. While 43,062 articles were found by all methods, 12,117 articles were only found by Pre2Pub.",
  "figure_5": "Integration in the search engine preVIEW, publicly available [22]. On the left, an overview of the amount of available peer-reviewed articles can be seen, which can be directly added to the search. On top of each article, if found, the link to the journal publication is provided and opens in a new tab by clicking."
