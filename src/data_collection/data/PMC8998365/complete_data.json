Then, by querying the PubMed application programming interface, a title search is performed. If this is successful, the authors are compared by our 5-step method. If not, we perform an author search directly in PubMed and compare then the titles. For the matching articles, the dates are checked and the pairwise abstract similarity is determined. Finally, the article with the highest similarity is returned—if it exceeds the threshold of 0.9.",
