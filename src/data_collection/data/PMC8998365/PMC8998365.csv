Figure 1.",PMC8998365_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Simplified overview of Pre2Pub’s working mechanism. The input is the metadata of a preprint. Then, by querying the PubMed application programming interface, a title search is performed. If this is successful, the authors are compared by our 5-step method. If not, we perform an author search directly in PubMed and compare then the titles. For the matching articles, the dates are checked and the pairwise abstract similarity is determined. Finally, the article with the highest similarity is returned—if it exceeds the threshold of 0.9.",./data/PMC8998365/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a9f9/8998365/0edbaed93e38/jmir_v24i4e34072_fig1.jpg

Combined data include data from both bioRxiv and medRxiv. The blue line comprises all available data, and the green line indicates the amount of preprints minus COVID-19–related papers.

In the 6 plots, the first bar indicates the total amount of preprints deposited in the preprint servers.
