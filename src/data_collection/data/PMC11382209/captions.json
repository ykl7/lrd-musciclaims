  "figure_6": "RISE, Grad-CAM, OA and LIME explanations by [65], display human annotations and explanations generated by mentioned methods for a COVID-19 CT image. Each explanation technique highlights salient regions responsible for the prediction. Human annotations highlight different salient regions. In the generated explanations, red regions indicate areas contributing to the prediction when using RISE, Grad-CAM, and OA. LIME differentiates pixels supporting the prediction in green and those negating the prediction in red.",
  "figure_7": "SHAP explanations by [72], illustrated feature importance using SHAP values. Each row in the figure represents a different feature, while each point corresponds to a sample. The colour gradient indicates the value of the feature: redder points signify larger values, while bluer points represent smaller values. In the context of mortality prediction, treated as a binary classification problem where 1 indicates death, the figure shows several red points on the right side of the SHAP values for features like CRP and LDH, suggesting that higher values of these features are associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conversely, for the lymphocyte feature, blue points are concentrated on the right, indicating that lower lymphocyte levels are linked to higher mortality. Overall, the figure demonstrates that elevated levels of LDH and CRP, along with reduced lymphocyte levels, are associated with a higher likelihood of death.",
  "figure_8": "CAM visualization utilizing the Saliency map by [82], illustrates results for four examples, showing annotated input images, ROI patches, saliency maps for benign and malignant classes, and ROI patches with attention scores. The top example features a circumscribed oval mass in the left upper breast middle depth, diagnosed as a benign fibroadenoma via ultrasound biopsy. The second example displays an irregular mass in the right lateral breast posterior depth, diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma via ultrasound biopsy. The third example's saliency maps identify benign findings: a circumscribed oval mass confirmed as a benign fibroadenoma, a smaller oval mass recommended for follow-up, and an asymmetry that is stable and benign. The bottom example shows segmental coarse heterogeneous calcifications in the right central breast middle depth, diagnosed as high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ via stereotactic biopsy.",
  "figure_9": "LRP, DTD and IG explanations by [91], present samples of heat maps for three classes: a. normal class, b. ADcR class, and c. ADsR class. The attributions were visualized with heat maps, highlighting important features for each diagnostic case. In all diagnostic cases, the boundary between the three TMJ components in contact with each other was highly activated. In some images, both the surface and the boundary of each component were activated. Despite the different approaches used for calculating explainability, the emphasis was consistently placed on the three TMJ components relevant to the diagnosis of TMJ ADD."
