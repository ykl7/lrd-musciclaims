PMC12095290,"The γ value was adjusted according to the co-occurrence of keywords, respectively, to obtain the keyword emergence analysis, with the blue line indicating the time interval and the red line indicating the time period in which the keyword emergence was found. “Children,” “autism spectrum disorder,” and “adolescents” are the earliest (1994) terms to appear. “Pervasive developmental disorder” is the earliest (1994) term to appear. “Pervasive developmental disorder” maintains a high intensity of occurrence from 1999 to 2013, with an intensity of 10.72, the highest intensity of emergence, suggesting that most children with autism are accompanied by developmental disorders, and that the US Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) includes autism as one of the disorders of pervasive developmental disorders. “Mental retardation” is the most frequently occurring keyword; most children with autism have varying degrees of mental retardation, and restoring the intelligence of children with autism has always been a central issue in rehabilitation. “Early intervention” and “patterns” are the most popular keywords in this field in the past 10 years, which indicates that the research on family therapy for autism is increasingly focusing on early intervention for children with autism at home as well as on intervention models (
