PMC10524449,"To assess individuals’ adaptation to time horizons, we developed a child-friendly Simplified Horizon Task (Figure 1, based on the Horizon Task; Wilson et al., 2014).",PMC10524449_figure_1,Figure 1. The Simplified Horizons Task.,"Note. Each practice and test trial began with two fixed-choices (A) followed by a free-choice portion (B). The number of free-choices varied by horizon condition and was indicated by the number of hands: Short= 1free-choice, Long = 4 free-choices, Ambiguous= 50% 1 free-choice and 50% 4 free-choices). For example, in the free-choice portion of a Short horizonstrial (B), asingle hand indicates one free-choice; once the participant makestheir initial free-choice, the trial ends.
