  "figure_1": "Note. Each practice and test trial began with two fixed-choices (A) followed by a free-choice portion (B). The number of free-choices varied by horizon condition and was indicated by the number of hands: Short= 1free-choice, Long = 4 free-choices, Ambiguous= 50% 1 free-choice and 50% 4 free-choices). For example, in the free-choice portion of a Short horizonstrial (B), asingle hand indicates one free-choice; once the participant makestheir initial free-choice, the trial ends.

  "figure_3": "Note. Adaptive exploration (exploring more under Long Horizons than Short Horizons) increased with age. Older children and adults explored more when horizons were Long than Short (p’s<.001), while younger children explored similarly across the two horizons (p=.084).",
  "figure_4": "Note. Younger Children and Adults who adapted more to time horizons gained significantly more total rewards compared with their same-age, less adaptive peers (p’s<.05). Older Children did not show this relationship (p=.40), likely due to ceiling effects.",
  "figure_5": "Note. Larger reward sizes of the exploit option on a trial predicted lower odds of exploring on that trial, p<.001.",
  "figure_6": "Note. The effect of the visible exploit reward-size on initial choices differed across age groups, 𝝌𝝌2(2)=39.05, p<.001: Older Children and Adults showed a significantly stronger effect than Younger Children did (p’s<.001), and Older Children showed a stronger effect than Adults (p=.02).",
  "figure_7": "Note. Dotted line = equal preference to explore and exploit. The lower and upper hinges of the box plots correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles), or the IQR (interquartile range). The upper and lower whiskers extend to the largest values no further than 1.5 * IQR from the corresponding hinge. Older children and Adults preferred to exploit rather than explore under Ambiguous Horizons (p’s<.01), whereas Younger Children did not (p=.45)."
