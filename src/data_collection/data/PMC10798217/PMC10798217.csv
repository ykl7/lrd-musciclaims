aEffect sizes for continuous outcomes are standardized mean differences (i.e., Cohen’s d), calculated from the results of linear mixed effect models and the standard deviation of the outcome at baseline.


bEffect sizes for count outcomes are incidence rate ratios (IRRs), calculated from results of Poisson generalized linear mixed effect models.
