  "figure_2": "Historical reporting and non‐reporting of sex and gonadectomy procedures in the title or abstract of murine skeletal articles published in period 1. A total of 24,718 scientific articles, published between January 1999 and December 2009 (period 1), were obtained in the “skeletal mouse search” using PubMed (A, left). Articles were screened for the inclusion of sex (male(s), female(s) or male(s) and female(s)) and the reporting of gonadectomy procedures (ovariectomy, OVX, orchidectomy, or ovariectomy and orchidectomy, OVX and ORX), independently of sex, in the corresponding titles or abstracts. Refined screening of articles in which sex or specified gonadectomy procedures were disclosed in the titles or abstracts were then used for the evaluation of sex bias and bias in the prevalence of gonadectomy procedures (A, right). Articles reporting gonadectomy in the title or abstract were excluded from the “skeletal mouse search” to resolve the extent of general sex reporting in murine skeletal studies (B, left) ahead of sex bias assessment (B, right). Data are expressed as pie charts with the number and percentage of articles in each segment displayed.",
  "figure_3": "Reporting and non‐reporting of sex and gonadectomy procedures in the title or abstract of murine skeletal articles published in period 2. A total of 48,157 scientific articles, published between January 2010 and December 2020 (period 2), were obtained in the “skeletal mouse search” using PubMed (A, left). Search results were subsequently filtered for the disclosure of sex of the mice and the reporting of gonadectomy procedures, without sex, in the titles or abstracts (A, left). Identified articles were subjected to analysis of sex bias and bias in gonadectomy procedure prevalence (A, right). Generalized reporting and non‐reporting of sex in the titles or abstracts of articles was examined after the exclusion of articles reporting gonadectomy procedures from search results (B, left) before sex bias evaluation (B, right). Data are expressed as pie charts with the number and percentage of articles in each segment displayed."
