The black dots indicate measured data from one jet, the shaded area indicates the deviation between the four sources.

  "figure_3": "Comparison of measured absolute atomic oxygen densities in similar plasma sources using different diagnostic techniques: ns-TALIF [36], synchrotron VUV absorption [10] and ps-TALIF [37]. The plasma sources operate in a helium carrier gas flow through a 1 mm discharge gap with varying humidity admixtures. The power delivery is a RF-CCP at 13.56 MHz.

  "figure_5": "Verification by convergence toward an exact solution as a numerical parameter is changed. In this example, the physical parameter is the conduction current density flowing in a thermionic diode, and the numerical parameter is the time step in a particle-in-cell simulation. The points with error bars are simulation data, and the curve indicates the expected rate of convergence, which is O(Δt2) in this case. Reproduced from [94]. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

  "figure_6": "(Left) Time evolution of the electron density and (right) the ionization rate calculated by the participants of the 2017–2018 round-robin exercise for the modelling of a pure argon plasma with four species (Ar, Ar* and Ar+ and e) undergoing the following electron-impact collisions: elastic scattering with Ar, direct excitation, direct ionization and dielectronic recombination. The plasma is excited by applying an electric field pulse to the neutral gas at 0.1 bar pressure and 300 K temperature, for initial electron and ion densities of 1 cm−3. The insert caption identifies the different model approximations that were used, where LFA refers to the ‘local field approximation’ in the Boltzmann-chemistry coupling.",
