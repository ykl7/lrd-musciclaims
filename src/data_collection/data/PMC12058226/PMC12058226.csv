In this example, the physical parameter is the conduction current density flowing in a thermionic diode, and the numerical parameter is the time step in a particle-in-cell simulation.

PMC12058226,"There has been a noticeable trend in the graphical presentation of data to move away from simpler x–y scatter plots, which show single points with error bars (or confidence internals) that are often not well-defined and ambiguously open to interpretation, to scatter plots that include the raw data with the statistical information overlaid [174]. (See, for example, figure 10.) In the physical sciences, concerns often arise based on how extracted quantities are determined and presented, where inconsistencies within a field make it difficult to both assess the validity of the claims in the paper and to compare to prior literature.",PMC12058226_figure_10,Figure 10.,Example of data being presented as the raw data (points) with the statistical information overlaid (red bars for the respective averages and 95% confidence interval error bars).
