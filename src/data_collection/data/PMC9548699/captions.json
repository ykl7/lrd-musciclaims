  "figure_2": "Pediatric psoriasis RCTs that reported efficacy data at 3 months. (A) PASI75 (B) PASI90 RRs—mean represented by the square—were calculated as percent response in biologics arm divided by percent response in control arm. Overall effect estimate is represented by the diamond, with the width showing the CIs for the overall estimated effect estimate. Further, 95% CIs for RRs—represented by the whiskers—were computed utilizing the exact method. All CIs that did not include 1 indicated significant effects. Experimental treatment is preferred when RR > 1. PASI, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; qw, every week; q2w, every 2 weeks; q4w, every 4 weeks; q12w, every 12 weeks; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RR, risk ratio. $ dosed at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter; # compared against methotrexate monotherapy instead of placebo.",
  "figure_3": "Comparing efficacy (PASI75 and PASI90 RRs) against safety (RD) in the pediatric psoriasis RCTs that reported both outcomes. (A) PASI75 RR versus SAEs RD; (B) PASI90 RR versus SAEs RD. PASI, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RD, risk difference; SAE, serious adverse event.",
  "figure_4": "Overall AEs, overall infections, UTRIs or gastroenteritis in the 5 included pediatric psoriasis RCTs. (A) Proportion (%) of patients with AEs in each study arm. Higher proportion of AEs in the control arm favors experimental treatment. (B) RD (%) of patients with AEs in each treatment arm compared to placebo or SOC. Treatment effect < 0 favors experimental treatment over control arm. AE, adverse event; MTX, methotrexate; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RD, risk difference."
