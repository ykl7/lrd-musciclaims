What does it all mean? However, clinician often makes this for you’. 9. ‘Having time to consider. Ability to process’. 10. ‘Peer‐peer/patient support groups’. 11. ‘Professional education, especially for rarer disorders’. 12. ‘Cultural/professional stigmas, discrimination concerns’. 13. ‘Empowerment of patient, improved advocacy, specialists’ 14. ‘Urgency: where do we capture this? Treatment versus risk reduction versus age‐related risks’. 15. ‘Timing of decision might be affected by other responsibilities, for example, young children to care for’. 16. ‘Other people's stories: maybe use video testimonials. Less of a “scenario” if it's spoken’.",
