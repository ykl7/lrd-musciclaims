  "figure_2": "Draft logic model for patient decision aid website/booklet, displayed on the wall in poster size during the workshop. Notes were affixed to this throughout the day with ideas and suggestions from patients and facilitators (shown in circles, numbered). 1. ‘These are our “active ingredients” for decision‐making’. 2. ‘Why doesn't the UK have panel genetic testing?’ 3. ‘Improve equity of access/opportunity for information’. 4. ‘This purple box should move up closer to the beginning’. 5. ‘Clinicians need to remember that we are people too, not just part of the process’. 6. ‘Use of language: clinician + patient ‐ WE’. 7. ‘Is my clinician “on board” with the decision aid usage?’ 8. ‘Heavy decision/burden. What does it all mean? However, clinician often makes this for you’. 9. ‘Having time to consider. Ability to process’. 10. ‘Peer‐peer/patient support groups’. 11. ‘Professional education, especially for rarer disorders’. 12. ‘Cultural/professional stigmas, discrimination concerns’. 13. ‘Empowerment of patient, improved advocacy, specialists’ 14. ‘Urgency: where do we capture this? Treatment versus risk reduction versus age‐related risks’. 15. ‘Timing of decision might be affected by other responsibilities, for example, young children to care for’. 16. ‘Other people's stories: maybe use video testimonials. Less of a “scenario” if it's spoken’.",
  "figure_3": "Theories considered and selected for short, lay‐friendly presentations at the workshop. Elwyn et al.\n27\n identified eight theories (shown in boxes) published between 1940 and 2010 with the most relevance to design and evaluation of decision‐support interventions. Additional theories or constructs from theories were also considered, based on publications found through forward citation‐searching, a rapid overview of the decision‐making theory literature and discussion amongst workshop organisers with expertise in psychology, health behaviour decision making and clinical genetics. The final theories presented at the workshop are numbered 1–6 and shown in blue ovals.",

Schematic map of subthemes (shown in boxes): autonomy, emotions, time of life, resilience, self‐efficacy, feeling alone/excluded, understanding risks, influence of others and uncertainty.
