RRs—mean represented by the square—were calculated as % response in bDMARD or JAK inhibitor arm divided by % response in control arm. Overall effect estimate is represented by the diamond, which width shows the confidence intervals for the overall estimated effect estimate. Further, 95% CIs for RRs—represented by the whiskers—were computed utilizing the exact method. All CIs that did not include 1 indicated significant effects. Experimental treatment is preferred when RR > 1.

  "figure_4": "Overall AEs, overall infections, upper respiratory infections or gastroenteritis in the 12 included RCTs. (A) Proportion (%) of patients with AEs in each study arm. Higher proportion of AEs in the placebo or SOC arm favors experimental treatment. (B) RD (%) of patients with AEs in each treatment arm compared to placebo or SOC. Treatment effect < 0 favors experimental treatment over placebo or SOC. AE, adverse event; MTX, methotrexate; SOC, standard of care. In the ACUTE-JIA study, the rate of overall AEs was 4.8 events/patient-year in the infliximab plus methotrexate arm and 6.5 events/patient-year in the methotrexate monotherapy arm. In the TENDER study, the rate of overall AEs was 9.3 events/patient-year in the tocilizumab arm and 9.4 events/patient-year in the placebo arm; corresponding rates of overall infections were 3.4 vs. 2.9 events/patient-year.",
