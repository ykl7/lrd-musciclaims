While the article was under review, we continued to maintain the project and accepted new contributions. The preprint was updated in January 2018, and the article was accepted by the journal in March 2018 [5]. As of March 06, 2019, the Deep Review repository accumulated 755 Git commits, 317 merged pull requests, 609 issues, and 819 GitHub stars.
