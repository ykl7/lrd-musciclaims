  "figure_1": "The total words added to the Deep Review by each author is plotted over time (final values in parentheses). These statistics were extracted from Git commit diffs of the manuscript’s Markdown source. This figure reveals the composition of written contributions to the manuscript at every point in its history. The Deep Review was initiated in August 2016, and the first complete manuscript was released as a preprint [10] in May 2017. While the article was under review, we continued to maintain the project and accepted new contributions. The preprint was updated in January 2018, and the article was accepted by the journal in March 2018 [5]. As of March 06, 2019, the Deep Review repository accumulated 755 Git commits, 317 merged pull requests, 609 issues, and 819 GitHub stars. The notebook to generate this figure can be interactively launched (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/greenelab/meta-review/binder?filepath=analyses/deep-review-contrib/02.contrib-viz.ipynb) using Binder [11], enabling users to explore alternative visualizations or analyses of the source data.",
