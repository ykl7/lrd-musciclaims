  "figure_1": "Conceptual illustration of central concepts from the special issue. Many of the papers note that mesoscale and large-scale patterns can emerge from fine-scale processes (emergent properties). However, observing fine-scale heterogeneity and upscaling that information remains a challenge. As such, there is a need for multiscale approaches to understanding eco-hydrobiogeochemical dynamics. Additionally, while this understanding is likely to improve management, there is currently a lack of data required to assess the effectiveness of water quality management. Providing effective management at the large scale will require the best data and the ability to expand fine-scale process understanding to mesoscale and large-scale extents."
