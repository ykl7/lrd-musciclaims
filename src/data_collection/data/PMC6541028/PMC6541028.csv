PMC6541028,"With this special issue, we hope to stimulate further discussion and interdisciplinary collaboration on these topics and synthesize emergent themes from the papers published herein (Figure 1).",PMC6541028_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Conceptual illustration of central concepts from the special issue. Many of the papers note that mesoscale and large-scale patterns can emerge from fine-scale processes (emergent properties). However, observing fine-scale heterogeneity and upscaling that information remains a challenge. As such, there is a need for multiscale approaches to understanding eco-hydrobiogeochemical dynamics. Additionally, while this understanding is likely to improve management, there is currently a lack of data required to assess the effectiveness of water quality management. Providing effective management at the large scale will require the best data and the ability to expand fine-scale process understanding to mesoscale and large-scale extents.",./data/PMC6541028/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/86c4/6541028/41296214ac78/nihms-1526658-f0001.jpg
