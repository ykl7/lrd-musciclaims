Select Media-Based Resources Referencing the New England Journal of Medicine Editorial on Large-Vessel Strokes in Young Patients With COVID-19, Published on April 28, 202015.","Unilateral arrows indicate direction of referencing material, for example, the Neurocritical Care Society referencing the article directly. All arrows are equivalent; dotted arrows are used when crossing other elements of the figure for clarity. Dates when a reference is created are shown if known. Note that the dates marked with an asterisk indicate that connections are made predating journal publication on April 28.
