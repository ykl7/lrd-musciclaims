All arrows are equivalent; dotted arrows are used when crossing other elements of the figure for clarity. Dates when a reference is created are shown if known. Note that the dates marked with an asterisk indicate that connections are made predating journal publication on April 28. For example, the BMC protocols were promoted on AAN Synapse weeks before adding a reference to the journal article. AAN = American Academy of Neurology; BMC = Boston Medical Center; NEJM = New England Journal of Medicine; Promotion (F) = formal promotion; Promotion (I) = informal promotion.",

All arrows are equivalent; dotted arrows are used when crossing other elements of the figure for clarity. Note that informal promotion resources may reference any of the other 3, formal promotion resources may reference the remaining 2, and the others may only reference a journal article directly. Promotion (F) = formal promotion; Promotion (I) = informal promotion; RCT = randomized control trial."
