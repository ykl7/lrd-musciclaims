  "figure_3": "Illustration of the two dispersal pathways in a stream network used to develop the predictor variables related to dispersal limiting factors. The black circle represents a Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) sample site in a stream network, represented by solid lines. The dashed lines represent the dispersal pathways used to calculate (a) predictor variables that represent the downstream dispersal to a B-IBI site from the upstream mainstem and tributaries; and (b) predictor variables that represent the upstream dispersal to a B-IBI site from the downstream mainstem only, which does not include from side tributaries and up the mainstem to a site. Note that the longitudinal origin of the analysis for downstream dispersal was from headwater streams, and for upstream dispersal, it was from an intercepting large waterbody such as the ocean or a large lake. The green and red circles illustrate how a barrier is factored into a barrier predictor variable. In this example, the green circle represents a small lake that will factor into the small lake predictor variable, while the red circle represents a small lake that will not be included in the small lake predictor."
