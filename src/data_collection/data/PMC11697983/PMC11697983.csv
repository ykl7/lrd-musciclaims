PMC11697983,"Consistent with hypotheses, higher emotional support during pregnancy showed a significant direct effect on perceived resilience to stress during pregnancy, even after covarying for instrumental support and other covariates (Figure 1a).",PMC11697983_figure_1,Figure 1.,"Moderated multiple mediation model predicting offspring externalizing behaviors from the direct and indirect effects of emotional support (1a) and instrumental support (1b) during pregnancy.
Note. *p < .05, **p < .01; dashed lines indicate paths that are not statistically significant. Unstandardized betas are shown. To increase specificity to social support type, model 1a and 1b covaried for instrumental support or emotional support, respectively; both models included resting HRV at baseline, HRV reactivity to stress test, week of pregnancy at prenatal visit, and child sex assigned at birth as covariates. The predictors and mediators in these models were measured concurrently during the prenatal visit, whereas the child outcomes were measured during the child visit at age 2–3.",./data/PMC11697983/images/figure_1.jpg,https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d2dc/11697983/902a5f1494b5/nihms-2044235-f0001.jpg
