Unstandardized betas are shown. To increase specificity to social support type, model 1a and 1b covaried for instrumental support or emotional support, respectively; both models included resting HRV at baseline, HRV reactivity to stress test, week of pregnancy at prenatal visit, and child sex assigned at birth as covariates. The predictors and mediators in these models were measured concurrently during the prenatal visit, whereas the child outcomes were measured during the child visit at age 2–3.",
