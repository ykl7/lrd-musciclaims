  "figure_2": "a Overlap between CH cases carrying gene mutations (GMs) and chromosomal alterations (mCAs). Number of subjects are shown in black. b, c The prevalence of mCA increases with mutation burden and VAF. Observed proportion of mCAs within each subgroup is shown as solid dots; 95% CIs generated from a binomial distribution around the observed proportion are shown in blue shades. Gene mutations in regions affected by mCAs are excluded from this analysis. d Age distribution of subjects with mCA only, gene mutations only, and both types of mutations. Unadjusted P values derived from a two-ended Student’s t-test are shown. The lower and upper bounds of boxes denote 25th (Q1) and 75th (Q3) percentiles of observed ages, respectively. The lower and upper whiskers indicate the minima (Q1 − 1.5*IQR) and maxima (Q3 + 1.5*IQR). e Volcano plot of q values and odds ratios of gene representation in mCA-positive versus mCA-negative cases (Fisher’s exact test). Genes significantly enriched (FDR < 0.05) in mCA subjects are colored in red. f Frequency of gene mutations significantly enriched in subjects with mCA. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
  "figure_3": "a mCA events and their co-occurring gene mutations. Events are colored by alteration types. Only genes that appear more than one time are shown. b Gene loci that exhibited recurrent double hits in cis. Zoom window shows the gene loci affected and the location of the gene mutations; “2” denotes two adjacent mutations in close proximity with each other. Centromere positions are marked in gray. Gene structures are displayed below. c Pairwise associations of co-mutations between specific mCAs and gene mutations. Associations with specific chromosomal alteration types are indicated by the position of the triangle (left: AMP, top: CNLOH, right: DEL, bottom: any). FDR-corrected significance values from pairwise Fisher’s exact tests are indicated by shapes of asterisks. Odds ratios are indicated by the transparency of red shading. The chromosomal location of genes are indicated by black squares. Gene labels are colored by functional groups. Source data are provided as a Source Data file."
