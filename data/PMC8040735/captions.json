  "figure_1": "Factors contributing to cancer health disparities in minorities. The origin of cancer health disparities is caused by a complex interaction between biological, sociological, environmental, and cultural factors. These factors play important roles that contribute at different levels to the health status of patients, including access to health-care systems, the possibility of a timely diagnosis, and access to treatment options. A combination of these factors results in a higher cancer burden and higher incidence and mortality rates in certain minority groups.",
  "figure_2": "Improving health care for minority groups. To improve health care for minority groups, it is essential to first identify the disparities that are present in minorities. These disparities can be grouped into three categories: (1) structural (left), (2) biological (middle), and (3) sociological (right). Structural disparities manifest through the unequal demographic distribution of minorities into areas with low economic opportunity, reduced educational opportunities, and poor living conditions. To ameliorate structural deficiencies, it is essential to raise awareness of these issues so that policies that advocate for minorities could be made. Identification of biological disparities may lead to the discovery of biomarkers unique to understudied racial/ethnic groups, which in turn leads to the development of new treatment options and improved enrollment in clinical trials. The ultimate goal is to establish a personalized approach for care of minority blood cancer patients. Last, sociological factors manifest as impediments to health care in minorities, through cultural belief systems, erroneous misconception of medicine, or ignorance from health-care providers regarding cultural sensitivities. Overcoming these obstacles can be done by putting efforts into education, with the end goal of increasing medical literacy within minority groups, while implementing a more culturally competent health-care system."
