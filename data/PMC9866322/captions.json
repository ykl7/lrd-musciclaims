  "figure_1": "Basal cell carcinoma. RCM mosaic (1500 × 1500 µm2) showing elongated cord-like structures and tumor islands (*) of different sizes delineated by dark clefts (white arrowhead). Large canalicular blood vessels (red arrowhead). Sparse plump-bright cells representing melanophages (white circle) and numerous bright cells with thin dendritic structures corresponding to melanocytes (white arrows) within the tumor islands.",
  "figure_2": "Squamous cell carcinoma. RCM mosaic (1500 × 1500 µm2) showing atypical honeycomb pattern with broadened and irregular intercellular connections, pleomorphic keratinocytes, varying in size and shape and areas of total architectural disarray; scarce large, round, nucleated cells representing dyskeratotic cells (white arrows) and scattered small, bright inflammatory cells (white arrowheads).",
  "figure_3": "Cutaneous melanoma. RCM mosaic (1500 × 1500 µm2) showing severe dermo-epidermal junction disarray and pleomorphic bright cells: large dendritic atypical cells (white arrows) with the tendency to form aggregates and roundish cells of different sizes in some areas forming scattered irregular clusters (white arrowheads), in others distributed in a diffuse pattern (white circle)."
