Notice that in right eye viewing condition (A), the left eye is deviated to the left and during left eye viewing (B), the right eye is deviated to the right indicative of an exodeviation. The viewing eye data obtained under monocular viewing is designated as the expected eye position – i.e., the right eye position data [blue trace in (A)] under right eye viewing is designated as right eye expected eye position data and vice versa whereas the non-viewing eye data obtained under monocular viewing is the actual eye position data, i.e., non-viewing right eye data [cyan trace in (B)] obtained under left eye viewing is designated as actual eye position data of the right eye and vice versa. (C,D) show the respective “expected” (dark blue and dark red traces) and “actual” eye position traces (light blue and light red) for the right (C) and left eye (D). Annotations on the side show median values for expected horizontal and expected vertical eye positions to use in the calculation of the angle of deviation. The eye deviation was measured by comparing the position of each eye with itself when it was viewing vs. non-viewing (i.e., expected and actual eye positions, respectively). (E,F) show the computed difference in horizontal and vertical planes between the “expected” and “actual” eye positions for the right (E) and left eyes (F).",
