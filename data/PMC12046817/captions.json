  "figure_1": "The stages of colonising the gut microbiome and various factors affecting it: The gut microbiome is initially colonised during the different stages and modes of birth and stages of child life. The factors such as genetics, ethnicity, diet, physical inactivity, obesity, age, smoking and antibiotics affect the health and composition of gut microbiota [313].

  "figure_3": "Impact of the therapeutic regimen administration on gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in brain cancer therapy: Administration of temozolomide, bevacizumab, high glucose diet, probiotics such as Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum changes the dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition. The microbial metabolites produced by the gut microbiota pass through the lymphatic, circulatory system, etc., reaching and crossing the blood-brain barrier and modulating the components in the microenvironment, ultimately regulating the progression of brain cancer. ↑ - increase, ↓ - decrease in the abundance.
