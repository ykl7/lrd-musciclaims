Hormones, medicaments, environmental factors, dysfunctional neural regulation of lacrimal gland secretion, poor aqueous tear flow, and excessive tear evaporation result in the development of THO. THO induces increased activation and maturation of dendritic cells, which generates a detrimental Th1 and Th17 cell-driven immune response in the eyes of DED patients. Through the production of inflammatory cytokines, Th1 and Th17 cells induce inflammation, which causes injury to the epithelial and goblet cells in the eyes of DED patients. The loss of goblet, corneal, and conjunctival epithelial cells results in excessive tear evaporation and tear film instability, which crucially contribute to the development of THO and DED.",

THO induces stress in the ER and promotes mitochondrial damage by enhancing Fas- and TRAIL-dependent activation of caspase-3, capsase-8, and caspase-9, which results in apoptosis of THO-exposed CECs. Additionally, THO promotes an increased expression of E and P selectins and induces an enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in CECs, which results in a massive influx of circulating immune cells in inflamed eyes of DED patients, resulting in the aggravation of ongoing inflammation.",
