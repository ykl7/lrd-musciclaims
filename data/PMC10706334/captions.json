  "figure_1": "Crucial factors contributing to the development of THO and DED. Hormones, medicaments, environmental factors, dysfunctional neural regulation of lacrimal gland secretion, poor aqueous tear flow, and excessive tear evaporation result in the development of THO. THO induces increased activation and maturation of dendritic cells, which generates a detrimental Th1 and Th17 cell-driven immune response in the eyes of DED patients. Through the production of inflammatory cytokines, Th1 and Th17 cells induce inflammation, which causes injury to the epithelial and goblet cells in the eyes of DED patients. The loss of goblet, corneal, and conjunctival epithelial cells results in excessive tear evaporation and tear film instability, which crucially contribute to the development of THO and DED.",
  "figure_2": "THO-induced changes in the phenotype and function of CECs. Apoptotic cell death is observed in THO-exposed CECs. THO induces stress in the ER and promotes mitochondrial damage by enhancing Fas- and TRAIL-dependent activation of caspase-3, capsase-8, and caspase-9, which results in apoptosis of THO-exposed CECs. Additionally, THO promotes an increased expression of E and P selectins and induces an enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in CECs, which results in a massive influx of circulating immune cells in inflamed eyes of DED patients, resulting in the aggravation of ongoing inflammation.",
  "figure_3": "Detrimental immune response in the eyes of DED patients. Increased expressions of MHC proteins and co-stimulatory molecules were noticed in eye-infiltrated DCs of DED patients. DCs of DED patients have increased capacities for the production of inflammatory, pro-Th1 (IL-12), and pro-Th17 cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23), crucially contributing to the generation of detrimental Th1 and Th17 cell-driven immune responses. Accordingly, an increased number of IFN-γ-producing Th1, NK, and NKT cells and an increased number of IL-17- and IL-22-producing Th17 cells were observed in the eyes of DED patients. Additionally, THO promotes NETosis in eye-infiltrated neutrophils, importantly contributing to the progression of DED.",
  "figure_4": "Therapeutic potential of hypo-osmotic eye drops in DED treatment. THO induces dehydration and consequent injury of CECs. Hypo-osmotic eye drops contain a lower concentration of salt and other solutes compared to the tears on the ocular surface. Accordingly, hypo-osmotic eye drops restore the natural osmotic balance of the ocular surface, improve tear film function, and attenuate THO-induced damage of the corneal epithelial barrier."
