  "figure_1": "Upper row: Brown, Hazel/Green, Blue and Albino eyes as seen by most of the tritanopic “normal” population. Lower row: the same eyes as would be perceived by a person with X-linked protanopia.",
  "figure_2": "Phenotype shown as brown or blue while dominant brown gene = B and recessive blue gene = b Individuals with bb have blue eyes, while individuals with BB or Bb have brown eyes.",
  "figure_3": "This shows three arms and the complete perceived spectrum of colours.",
  "figure_4": "Colour names shaded to the colour mentioned.",
  "figure_5": "This shows a continuum of green with brown iris colour, ranging from small pupil ring to almost complete brown with peripheral green flecks.",
  "figure_6": "Parents above with blue-green eyes have two children below with dark brown eyes.",
  "figure_7": "One parent may be recessive at the first step, while the other parent may be recessive at the second step. Thus, for each step, one of the parents does provide a “normal” copy of the gene needed and thus pigment is produced (although it may be reduced in amount).",
  "figure_8": "Note the increased similarity of eye colour in the identical twins.",
  "figure_9": "Blue eyes are most common around the Baltic Sea. (creative commons Robert Frost) (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eye_colors_map_of_Europe.png#filelinks).",
  "figure_11": "Each SNP in the study is shown in relation to its chromosomal location on the X-axis and the p value on the Y-axis. The p values > 8 are statistically significant, with some highly significant genes resembling Manhattan skyscrapers. Image provided by Mark Simcoe from data in reference [22] Simcoe et al.",

  "figure_14": "These would be less geometrically shaped in real life. Areas in black would perceive a red light as black (protanopic from affected father or carrier mother) while areas in red would perceive red light as red (normal tritanope from normal parent).",
