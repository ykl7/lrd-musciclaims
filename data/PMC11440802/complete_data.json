MIP PET images (A) showed numerous foci of [18F]FDG abnormal uptake. Sagittal view (B and C, CT and PET/CT fusion images) showed numerous bone osteolytic hypermetabolic metastases. Axial PET/CT fusion images showed the primary left breast cancer (D), axillary lymph nodes (E) and liver metastases (F). The disease was classified stage IV.",

Baseline PET/CT staging performed after surgery showed no pathological [18F]FDG uptake (A, whole body PET MIP image, and B, C, axial CT and PET/CT fusion images of the iliac bones). Two years later, the patient was referred for a new [18F]FDG PET/CT examination because of isolated CEA elevation. A single lytic metastasis of the right iliac bone (red arrows) was detected (D, whole body PET MIP image; and E, F, axial CT and PET/CT fusion images of the iliac bone). The patient was treated with stereotaxic radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Six months later, PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response (G, H, I). The focus of the right iliac bone was replaced by a non-[18F]FDG-avid osteosclerosis (blue arrows) suggestive of a healed lesion (H and I, axial views of CT and PET/CT fusion image).",
