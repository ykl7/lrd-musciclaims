  "figure_1": "Biosynthetic pathway for studied bisretinoids. POS, photoreceptor outer segment; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium. The pathway is comprised of pyridinium bisretinoids A2E (I), A2GPE (2), a dihydropyridinium bisretinoid A2DHPE (4) and 2 cyclohexadiene bisretinoids atRALdi and atRALdi-E along with monofuran-A2E (4). Compounds 1 to 4 were analysed in this study. Abbreviations: A2E, N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine; A2GPE, A2-glycerophosphoethanolamine; A2DHPE, dihydropyridine phosphatidyl ethanolamine; atRALdi, all trans retinal dimer; atRALdi-E, all trans retinal dimer ethanolamine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine, MW, molecular weight in g/mol; PLD, phospholipase D.

  "figure_2": "A2E (ng) in macular and peripheral samples of 262 eyes of 139 donors. Box and whisker plot shows A2E quantified using a synthetic standard in macula and peripheral retina by donors <60 and ≥60 years of age. Y-axis is log-transformed for display. The P values are reported as a Kruskal-Wallis rank test between P(eripheral) and M(acula) within groups. Because the differences between M and P are so significant, all P values are less than 0.0001.",
  "figure_3": "Correlation of A2E referenced to synthetic standard (ng) and 50-eye-extract (EEEQ). X-axis represents A2E (ng) values and Y-axis represents A2E (EEEQ) from same human donors including the macula and peripheral retina with age ranging from 40 to 80 years. The graph shows 259 human eyes (481 absolute-relative paired values from macula and periphery) accessioned 2015 to 2016; 118 eyes accessioned 2014 were omitted. See Methods section for details.",
  "figure_4": "Representative LC-ESI-MS chromatograms using selected ion monitoring mode of quantification. Highlighted blue peaks represent elution profiles of individual bisretinoids including A2E, A2GPE, monofuran-A2E, and A2DHPE from a single chromatographic injection. Retention time is shown on the x-axis and intensity relative to the peak for that compound is shown on the y-axis (please note the different y-axis scales). Data from a 68-year-old male donor.",
  "figure_7": "Relationship of rod photoreceptors, fundus autofluorescence, and samples for bisretinoid assay. In (A and B), the optic nerve head is a dark circle, and the fovea is a region of low signal intensity. The circles represent 8 mm diameter tissue punches assayed for bisretinoids in this study, one centered on the macula and one centered in the temporal periphery. The frame (8.64 mm or 30 degrees on a side) indicates the area captured by fundus autofluorescence imaging with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering). A Distribution of rods, average of 5 human eyes aged 27 to 37 years, shown as a fundus of a left eye.58 Color scale is linear from 0 to 200,000 cells/ mm2. B Wide-field 488 nm autofluorescence image of a left eye of a 35-year-old adult (California, Optos PLC; courtesy of Dr. Lajos Csincsik). The yellow annulus represents the qAF8 ring where autofluorescence intensity is measured (qAF8) on a Spectralis, shown in the context of pan-retinal autofluorescence. (C) Cones and rods per mm2 along the horizontal meridian in the eyes shown in A. The lines labeled M and P represent the macula and peripheral tissue punches in A. The gap in the nasal retina represents the optic nerve head."
