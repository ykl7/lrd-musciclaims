Low risk (cyan) refers to the number of studies that have a low risk of bias in the respective domain. Unclear (gray) refers to the number of studies that have an unclear risk of bias in the respective domain due to lack of information reported by the study. High risk (purple) refers to the number of studies that have a high risk of bias in the respective domain. a. Risk of Bias Assessment b. Applicability Concerns.",
