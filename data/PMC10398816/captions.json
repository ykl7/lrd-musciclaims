(B) Clinicopathological characteristics for the patients included in the study. Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ctDNA, circulating tumor DNA; ddPCR, droplet digital PCR; ETMR, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes; EVD, external ventricular drain; GTR, gross-total resection; m, months; NTR, near-total resection; RT, radiation therapy; WGS, whole-genome sequencing; WHO, World Health Organization; y, years,1–5; surgeries in order; *, at primary diagnosis; **, primary surgery (days postdiagnosis); deceased.",
  "figure_2": "Molecular features of pediatric brain tumors in the study. Summary of somatic variants identified across 12 primary brain tumors (3 ependymomas, 7 medulloblastomas, 1 embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, and 1 CNS neuroblastoma) using whole-genome sequencing. Upper plot represents the tumor mutation burden. Mutations in selected genes are shown in the oncoplot with mutation type indicated in the color legend. The color bars below the plot show tumors with whole-genome duplication and indicate the tumor type. Abbreviations: cnLOH, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity; CNS, central nervous system; NA, not applicable; TMB, tumor mutation burden; WGD, whole-genome duplication.",
  "figure_3": "Comparison of mutant allele frequency in tumor tissue samples quantified from tumor tissue by WGS and ddPCR. (A) Linear regression from the comparison of WGS and ddPCR MAFs. The linear regression line is marked in red. (B) Bland-Altman plot of the differences (WGS (MAF) – ddPCR (MAF); SD of bias = 6.799). Yellow circles represent ependymoma, purple CNS neuroblastoma, and black medulloblastoma samples. For both analyses, n = 24. Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; ddPCR, droplet digital PCR; MAF, mutant allele frequency; WGS, whole-genome sequencing.",
  "figure_4": "CSF ctDNA concentration in patients with better outcome primary pediatric brain cancer. ctDNA levels quantified by ddPCR in serially collected CSF samples are plotted against time in (A) Patient 6 (medulloblastoma), (B) Patient 7 (CNS neuroblastoma), (C–F) Patients 9–12 (medulloblastoma) and (G) Patient 2 (ependymoma). Data points in red represent ctDNA extracted from the external ventricular drain CSF samples, whilst ctDNA extracted from lumbar puncture CSF samples is marked in black. Data represent mean ± SD for the selected assays (summarized in Table 1). Surgical and imaging (MRI) time points are indicated on the plots with radiological findings provided for each time point (colors assigned as per the legend). The shaded boxes indicate treatment time frames. Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ctDNA, circulating tumor DNA; ddPCR, droplet digital PCR; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.",

Data points in red represent ctDNA extracted from the external ventricular drain CSF samples, in blue ctDNA extracted from the shunt tap CSF, and ctDNA extracted from lumbar puncture CSF samples is marked in black. Data represent mean ± SD for the selected assays (summarized in Table 1). Surgical and imaging (MRI) time points are indicated on the plots with radiological findings provided for each time point (colors assigned as per the legend).
