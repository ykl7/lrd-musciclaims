Upon ligand binding the AHR translocates to the nucleus and binds to AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). The heterodimer binds to xenobiotic response elements (XRE) in the promoters of AHR target genes increasing their expression. AHR activation enhances glioma cell malignancy. Furthermore, several immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1), regulatory B cells (Breg), natural killer (NK) cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are influenced by AHR activation. TAMs express the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 that collaboratively produce adenosine which limit T cell function.
