Top left: overview of neuropsychiatric effects of Trp catabolites. Bottom left: Blood-brain barrier and glial cells determine local transport and metabolism of Trp and Trp-catabolites. Top right: Pleiotropic enzymatic digestion of exogenous Trp by brain tumor cells. Bottom right: Mechanisms for enzymatic digestion of Trp and biological effects of downstream catabolites. Kyn: kynurenine, KynA: kynurenic acid, QA: quinolinic acid, 3-HAA: 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid, 3-HK: 3-hydroxykynurenine, IDO1: indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, IL4I1: Interleukin-4-Induced-1, I3P: indole-3-pyruvic acid, TDO2: tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, QPRT: quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, AHR: aryl hydrocarbon receptor, NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, WARS: tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.",
  "figure_2": "Effects of tryptophan deprivation.\nLow intracellular (ic) tryptophan (Trp) levels can mediate pro-tumorigenic (blue background) and anti-tumorigenic effects (green background). Mechanisms described in glioma models are highlighted in black letters, mechanisms described in other systems are highlighted in gray. Abbreviations: GCN2: general control non-derepressible-2, p-eIF2α: phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, ATF4: activating transcription factor 4, WARS: tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, IFN-γ: interferon-gamma.",
  "figure_3": "Tryptophan metabolism in glioma yields NAD that can mediate therapy resistance.\nCollaborative degradation of tryptophan (Trp) in glioma by microglia and glioma cells yields nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) that can mediate therapy resistance in glioma. Therapeutic agents induce quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), NAD and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that consecutively mediate resistance to therapy, for example, the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.

  "figure_4": "Tryptophan catabolism promotes tumor cell malignancy and immune suppression via activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).\nThe tryptophan (Trp)-catabolic enzymes (TCEs) indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) initiate Trp degradation to the AHR-activating metabolites kynurenine (Kyn), kynurenic acid (KynA) and cinnabarinic acid (CA), while interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4I1) generates the AHR agonists indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P), indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) and KynA. Upon ligand binding the AHR translocates to the nucleus and binds to AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). The heterodimer binds to xenobiotic response elements (XRE) in the promoters of AHR target genes increasing their expression. AHR activation enhances glioma cell malignancy. Furthermore, several immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1), regulatory B cells (Breg), natural killer (NK) cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are influenced by AHR activation. TAMs express the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 that collaboratively produce adenosine which limit T cell function.
