Subsequently, the women would be stratified into appropriate risk groups such that they can receive tailored interventions. This approach might mean that some women start mammographic screening at a younger age, have different screening intervals or have supplemental screening with another imaging modality, such as MRI. Women deemed to be at higher risk of breast cancer could, in addition, be offered prophylactic treatment. A healthy lifestyle would be recommended to all women, independent of risk level.",

Decision-making regarding these questions will be influenced by the research evidence, the available resources, the health-care setting and societal values, preferences and social norms. The choices made in addressing each of these questions will determine whether the programme will be effective in reducing cancer-specific death and improving the benefit–harm balance of screening and be cost-effective, acceptable, accessible and feasible to implement. Dynamic interactions exist between each of these factors, and thus a change in one factor affects all others. Hence, the importance of a holistic, ‘systems thinking’ approach.",
