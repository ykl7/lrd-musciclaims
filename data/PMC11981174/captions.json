  "figure_1": "(A-B) Animals were fed control or map3k1 dsRNA 6 times over 2 weeks, then amputated into head, trunk and tail fragments and allowed to regenerate for 14 days or left uninjured for an equal amount of time, followed by (A) live imaging or (B) FISH to detect opsin and tyrosinase markers of eye cells. In each type of regenerating fragment, map3k1 RNAi caused formation of ectopic eyes (red arrowheads) that contained opsin+ photoreceptor neurons and tyrosinase+ pigment cup cells. (C) Homeostatic map3k1(RNAi) and control animals were stained with anti-ARRESTIN antibody to mark photoreceptor neuron axons. map3k1 inhibition caused formation of ectopic ARRESTIN+ axons projecting toward the brain (white arrowheads). Scale bars 50μm. (D) Uninjured animals were fed with dsRNA twice per week for the times indicated and live imaged in a timeseries to visualize the progression of the map3k1(RNAi) phenotype. map3k1(RNAi) caused a progressive formation of additional eyes mainly located within the head region. Scorings indicate the number of animals which appeared normal (controls) or because of map3k1 RNAi had any ectopic eyes (A, B, D) or ectopic axons (C).",
  "figure_2": "Homeostatic animals fixed after 3 or 4 weeks of RNAi were stained with markers to detect the effects of map3k1 on brain and body patterning. (A) ndk RNAi caused an expected increase in the domain size (left images) and number (right quantifications) of brain-associated cintillo cells, while map3k1 RNAi had no effect. Right, box plots overlayed with jittered scatterplots showing individual datapoints displaying the per-animal number of cintillo+ cells normalized to body area in millimeters2 (mm2). *, p<0.05; n.s. represents p>0.05 as calculated by 2-tailed unpaired t-test; sample sizes for each condition are n≥6. Scale bars, 100μm. (B) Likewise, map3k1 RNAi did not change the AP distribution of brain branches marked by GluR, while ndk RNAi resulted in ectopic brain branches forming throughout the body. Right, box plots showing the distance from the anterior tip of the animal to the most posterior GluR expression in the brain, relative to body length, for each of the corresponding RNAi conditions. ******, p<1E-7, n.s. represents p>0.05 as calculated by 2-tailed unpaired t-test; sample sizes for each condition are n≥7. Scale bars, 300μm. (C-D) Control and map3k1(RNAi) animals stained for position control gene (PCG) markers of (C) anterior and posterior body patterning. Expression domains were either assessed after 14 days of regeneration following 2 weeks of dsRNA feeding and amputation of tails (wnt1), or assessed in uninjured animals treated with dsRNA for 3 weeks prior to fixation (all other probes). Right, plots showing quantification of expression domain sizes normalized to body length in Fiji/ImageJ. The sizes of foxD, notum, sfrp1, ndk, and ndl5 expression domains were measured starting from the head tip to the posterior-most boundary of expression. ndl3 occupies a position that does not reach the tip of the head, so the AP extent of this domain was measured instead. wnt1, fzd4, and wntp-2 expression domain sizes were measured from the anterior-most expression to the tip of the tail. Each condition had a sample size of at least 5 animals. **, p<0.01; n.s., p>0.05 as calculated by 2-tailed unpaired t-test. Scale bars, 300μm. map3k1 RNAi did not cause a measurable change to the expression domains for the majority of genes tested, and caused a small but statistically significant increase in the expression domain of ndl5 expression. Scorings indicate the number of animals with characteristics similar to the images shown.",
  "figure_3": "Double RNAi experiments were conducted to test potential interactions between notum and map3k1 genes whose individual inhibition causes spatially distinct ectopic eye phenotypes. Animals were fed dsRNA every 2-3 days for 4 weeks before live scoring (top panels) and fixation to detect opsin+ eye cells (bottom panels). As expected, notum(RNAi) animals formed anterior ectopic eyes (13/13), while map3k1(RNAi) animals formed posterior ectopic eyes (14/14). However, nearly all map3k1;notum(RNAi) animals formed a synthetic phenotype in which both anterior and posterior ectopic eyes formed (14/15). Therefore, it is likely that map3k1 and Wnt pathways regulate distinct processes in eye formation. Yellow arrows are used to highlight anterior ectopic eyes while green arrows are used to highlight posterior ectopic eyes. Single-RNAi conditions involved combining control dsRNA with an equal amount of experimental dsRNA so that all treatments received the same total amount of dsRNA. Scale bars, 100μm.",
  "figure_4": "Uninjured control and map3k1(RNAi) animals fixed after 3 weeks of RNAi and stained with opsin riboprobe to quantify numbers of eye cells in each condition. Eye cells are present in close association with each other, necessitating an image analysis workflow for their quantification. Z-stacks capturing all eye cells were obtained through confocal imaging, then slices 5-microns apart were selected to represent each stack for 2D segmentation using Stardist, followed by assignment of nuclei as opsin+ using a global threshold and summing number of positive cells across the selected stacks for each animal. (A) Example of an image slice after nuclei segmentation and assignment of opsin+ nuclei (red overlay, right) of how opsin+ cells were counted for one z-stack. (B) Scaled images of example z-stacks from control and map3k1(RNAi) animals showing that map3k1 inhibition resulted in an expansion of eye regions. (C) Total number of opsin+ cells counted in control versus map3k1(RNAi) animals. map3k1 inhibition caused an increase to the number of measured eye cells. Plots show data points overlaid with boxplots. **p=0.01 by 2-tailed unpaired t-test. n=8 animals. Scale bars, 25μm.",
  "figure_5": "Homeostasis animals were treated with the indicated dsRNA for 3 weeks (control RNAi, wnt11-6 RNAi) or 6 weeks (control RNAi, map3k1 RNAi, ndk RNAi) followed by live imaging to detect the location of eyes or fixing and staining to detect the location of migratory ovo+ cells (eye progenitors) in unfed uninjured animals. (A) Planarians lack a fixed size, so in order to make comparisons across treatments, locations of ectopic eyes and eye progenitors in each image were defined and then registered and normalized to the location of the original eyes in order to create a common coordinate system (see Methods). These data were plotted along normalized AP (y.coord) and ML (x.coord) axes with units equal to one-half of the distance between the normal eyes of control animals or between the original eyes in ndk(RNAi), wnt11-6(RNAi), and map3k1(RNAi) conditions. Eye position measurements and assignment to a coordinate system are shown for a representative map3k1(RNAi) animal. (B) Scatterplot of control eyes (black dots, from 5 animals) versus map3k1(RNAi) ectopic eyes (light blue dots, from 8 animals) shows that map3k1 inhibition caused formation of ectopic eyes in a distribution located laterally and posteriorly compared to control eye locations. However, rare map3k1(RNAi) ectopic eyes were also identified slightly anterior to the original eyes (2 blue dots with y.coord > 0). (C, top) Plots of ectopic eye locations in ndk(RNAi) (green dots) or wnt11-6(RNAi) animals (purple dots) with respect to control eyes (black dots). (C, bottom) Graphs comparing locations of ectopic eyes in map3k1(RNAi) (blue dots) versus either ndk(RNAi) animals (green dots) or wnt11-6(RNAi) animals (purple dots). Both ndk RNAi and wnt11-6 RNAi caused a tighter distribution of ectopic eyes that were located more directly posterior to the original eyes compared to the broader distribution of map3k1(RNAi) ectopic eyes located more laterally. (D, left) Locations of migratory ovo+ eye progenitors from control uninjured animals (pink dots) were compared to ovo+ mature eyes (black). (D, right) Locations of ovo+ eye progenitors (pink dots) were compared to locations of ectopic eyes from map3k1(RNAi) animals (blue dots). map3k1 inhibition caused formation of ectopic eyes in a set of locations overlapping with the location of the eye progenitors from control animals.",
  "figure_6": "(A) Animals were treated with control and map3k1 dsRNA for 2 or 3 weeks prior to amputation of heads, and the resulting regenerating trunk fragments were fixed in a time series followed by staining with an ovo riboprobe to detect migratory eye progenitors (red) and simultaneously with mixture of opsin and tyrosinase riboprobes (green) to detect mature eye cells. Yellow coloring indicates overlap of green and red signals, with mature eyes expressing both ovo and opsin/tyrosinase. Data for 0dpa and 2dpa were aggregated from two experiments. Data for 5dpa, 8dpa, and 14dpa were aggregated from two different experiments. In map3k1(RNAi) animals, a subpopulation of migratory ovo+ cells located outside of mature eye structures expressed high levels of opsin/tyrosinase+ (examples indicated by yellow arrows, insets show magnifications of representative cells), while ovo+ progenitors in control animals had minimal opsin/tyrosinase+ expression (insets) (qualifications in panel D). (B) Boxplots showing the numbers of ovo+ migratory progenitors for each timepoint and condition quantified by manual scoring of maximum projection images. The number of undifferentiated ovo+ eye progenitors did not change significantly in map3k1(RNAi) worms at 0, 2, 5, and 8dpa. At 14dpa, a time when ectopic eyes began to emerge, map3k1(RNAi) worms showed a decrease in ovo+ eye progenitors. (C) Boxplots showing the total number of opsin/tyrosinase+ differentiated eye cells in animals at the indicated conditions and timepoints. The total number of opsin/tyrosinase+ differentiated eye cells in each animal were counted as in Fig 4 by confocal imaging of whole eyes, 2D segmentation of nuclei using Stardist on z-slices selected every 5 microns, assigning nuclei as opsin/tyrosinase+ using a global threshold, and summing the total number positive cells across all z-stacks for each animal. Numbers of opsin/tyrosinase+ differentiated eye cells were the same between control and map3k1(RNAi) animals at 8 dpa but their numbers increased in map3k1(RNAi) animals at 14 dpa. (D) Boxplots quantifying numbers of ovo+ cells away from mature eyes that prematurely expressed opsin/tyrosinase (denoted by yellow arrows in (A) in animals of each condition at 8 dpa and 14 dpa, as manually scored from maximum projection confocal images. map3k1 RNAi significantly elevated the number of migratory cells expressing opsin/tyrosinase markers of terminal eye cell differentiation at both 8dpa and 14dpa. Plots show data points from individual animals overlaid with boxplots. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, n.s. represents p>0.05 by a 2-tailed unpaired t-test. Scale bars, 100μm.",
  "figure_7": "Members of MAP2K and MAPK gene families were inhibited in order to identify signals downstream of map3k1 regulating eye formation. Animals were treated with indicated dsRNAs for 2 weeks (A-B) or 3 weeks (C) prior to amputation of tails and allowed to regenerate for 7 days (B) or 14 days (A, C) followed by live imaging. (A) While map3k1(RNAi) animals developed ectopic eyes as expected (red arrows), single gene inhibitions of map2k genes did not cause formation of ectopic eyes. (B) map2k4;map2k7(RNAi) animals were observed to develop posterior ectopic eyes (red arrow) through live imaging. Double FISH detecting opsin+ photoreceptor neurons and tyrosinase+ pigment cup cells showed that the ectopic eyes contained both opsin+ and tyrosinase+ cells (white arrows). (C) Inhibition of both homologs of the planarian p38, or jnk, caused ectopic eyes to form in regenerating head fragments. Scorings indicate the number of animals displaying the phenotype depicted in each panel.",
  "figure_8": "Model of the role of map3k1 in eye regulation. Head patterning factors such as notum and wnt11-6/wntA regulate a target zone for eye placement in regeneration, while map3k1 suppresses terminal differentiation of migratory eye progenitors by activating Map2k4/Map2k7-JNK/p38 downstream signals. map3k1 and downstream factors could operate in migratory progenitors or some other cell type(s) to control eye cell terminal differentiation."
