In each type of regenerating fragment, map3k1 RNAi caused formation of ectopic eyes (red arrowheads) that contained opsin+ photoreceptor neurons and tyrosinase+ pigment cup cells. (C) Homeostatic map3k1(RNAi) and control animals were stained with anti-ARRESTIN antibody to mark photoreceptor neuron axons. map3k1 inhibition caused formation of ectopic ARRESTIN+ axons projecting toward the brain (white arrowheads). Scale bars 50μm. (D) Uninjured animals were fed with dsRNA twice per week for the times indicated and live imaged in a timeseries to visualize the progression of the map3k1(RNAi) phenotype. map3k1(RNAi) caused a progressive formation of additional eyes mainly located within the head region. Scorings indicate the number of animals which appeared normal (controls) or because of map3k1 RNAi had any ectopic eyes (A, B, D) or ectopic axons (C).",

Animals were fed dsRNA every 2-3 days for 4 weeks before live scoring (top panels) and fixation to detect opsin+ eye cells (bottom panels). As expected, notum(RNAi) animals formed anterior ectopic eyes (13/13), while map3k1(RNAi) animals formed posterior ectopic eyes (14/14). However, nearly all map3k1;notum(RNAi) animals formed a synthetic phenotype in which both anterior and posterior ectopic eyes formed (14/15). Therefore, it is likely that map3k1 and Wnt pathways regulate distinct processes in eye formation. Yellow arrows are used to highlight anterior ectopic eyes while green arrows are used to highlight posterior ectopic eyes. Single-RNAi conditions involved combining control dsRNA with an equal amount of experimental dsRNA so that all treatments received the same total amount of dsRNA. Scale bars, 100μm.",

(A) Planarians lack a fixed size, so in order to make comparisons across treatments, locations of ectopic eyes and eye progenitors in each image were defined and then registered and normalized to the location of the original eyes in order to create a common coordinate system (see Methods). These data were plotted along normalized AP (y.coord) and ML (x.coord) axes with units equal to one-half of the distance between the normal eyes of control animals or between the original eyes in ndk(RNAi), wnt11-6(RNAi), and map3k1(RNAi) conditions.

(B) Scatterplot of control eyes (black dots, from 5 animals) versus map3k1(RNAi) ectopic eyes (light blue dots, from 8 animals) shows that map3k1 inhibition caused formation of ectopic eyes in a distribution located laterally and posteriorly compared to control eye locations. However, rare map3k1(RNAi) ectopic eyes were also identified slightly anterior to the original eyes (2 blue dots with y.coord > 0).
