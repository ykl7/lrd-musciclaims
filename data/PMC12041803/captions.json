  "figure_1": "Runaway theory of why humans evolved blue eyes. Left column: mechanisms. Middle column: specific rationales (core ones are on a dark background). Right column: predictions (dark background) and prediction statuses (light background). All predictions refer to individuals of European descent in populations with eye color polymorphism. Predictions that, for lack of relevant data, cannot at present be assessed are provided as independent tests and formulated so as to be fully falsifiable: critical predictions are unavoidable consequences of the hypothesis, and would speak against it if they were disproved; noncritical ones are based on auxiliary assumptions that are not necessarily true, so their rejection is not a rejection of the hypothesis. As shown by the arrows on the right side, predictions 4 and 5 are special cases of prediction 3; predictions 9, 10, and 12 are special cases of prediction 8.",
  "figure_2": "These studies presented pairs of male or female faces differing only in eye color: light (blue or green) vs. dark (brown or dark brown). Top: blue/dark-brown pair. Bottom: brown/green pair. Participants were asked “If you were looking for a long- (short-) term relationship, which of these two people would you prefer?”; they also rated each face’s attractiveness on a 0–10 scale. A description of the methods used in these studies is available online (see Data Availability section). The face depicted here was created digitally for purposes of illustration (Bressan, 2020a); all studies showed photographs of real people whose iris color had been digitally retouched.

  "figure_4": "Facial attractiveness of potential sex partners as a function of their eye color, as estimated on a 0–10 scale by men (left panel) and women (right panel). The graphs show that, all else being equal, both sexes like blue eyes best and dark-brown eyes least. As to green and brown, men give them similar ratings (left panel) but prefer green to brown eyes when asked to choose between the two (M = 60%, one-sample t (569) = 51.9, p < 0.0001). The data pertain to the experimental condition in which ratings of physical attractiveness are least biased (a short-term mating context, presented before rather than after a long-term one: Bressan, 2021b). Error bars indicate one standard error of the mean. Data were collected in Italy and refer to all participants (men, N = 571; women, N = 512) who had blue, green, brown, or dark brown eyes; the preference pattern was the same within each of these subsamples. Data source: see Data Availability section."
