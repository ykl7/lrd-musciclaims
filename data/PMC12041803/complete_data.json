Right column: predictions (dark background) and prediction statuses (light background). All predictions refer to individuals of European descent in populations with eye color polymorphism. Predictions that, for lack of relevant data, cannot at present be assessed are provided as independent tests and formulated so as to be fully falsifiable: critical predictions are unavoidable consequences of the hypothesis, and would speak against it if they were disproved; noncritical ones are based on auxiliary assumptions that are not necessarily true, so their rejection is not a rejection of the hypothesis. As shown by the arrows on the right side, predictions 4 and 5 are special cases of prediction 3; predictions 9, 10, and 12 are special cases of prediction 8.",

As to green and brown, men give them similar ratings (left panel) but prefer green to brown eyes when asked to choose between the two (M = 60%, one-sample t (569) = 51.9, p < 0.0001).
