The figure illustrates that the resting microglia can be activated into M1/M2 phenotype in response to different stimuli. Microglia of M1 phenotype play roles in promoting inflammation, damaging the tissues, antigen presentation, and killing tumor cells. Microglia of M2 phenotype play roles in anti-inflammation, repairing of the tissues, promoting angiogenesis, suppressing immunity, and promoting tumor progression.",

Subsequently, the tumor microenvironment is reestablished through angiogenesis and reprogrammed immunity. Metastatic cancer cells produce molecules, such as miRNAs and immunosuppressive factors, that help them communicate and adapt to the brain environment. (A) Metastatic cancer cells reprogram adaptive immunity through the PD1/PD-l1 and CTLA4/CD80 immune checkpoints, leading to immune evasion and immunosuppression. (B) Astrocytes, cancer cells, and microglia interact with each other through the secretion of chemokines and cytokines. Activated STAT3, NF-κB, AKT-MAPK pathways in cancer cells lead to tumor proliferation and growth. CCL2 and CCL10, which are secreted by metastatic cancer cells, recruit more immunosuppressive microglia. (C) c-Met, RAGE, and VEGF overproduced by M2 microglia promote tumor angiogenesis. (D) Interactions between metastatic cancer cells, microglia, and T cells promote immune escape. Exosomal miRNAs contribute to microglial M2 polarization, which promotes cancer cell colonization and inhibits the cytotoxic effects of T-cells through the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines.",
