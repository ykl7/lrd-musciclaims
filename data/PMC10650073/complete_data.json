UBE2C-induced degradation of cyclin B inactivates Cdk1, allowing the exchange of Cdc20 by Cdh1 in the APC/C-UBE2C complex, which becomes activated. The activated complex degrades securin, allowing separase to be activated and degrade the cohesin rings of sister chromatids. This leads to anaphase onset and mitotic exit.",
