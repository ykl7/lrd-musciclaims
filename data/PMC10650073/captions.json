  "figure_1": "UBE2C induces metaphase to anaphase transition during the cell cycle. UBE2C-induced degradation of cyclin B inactivates Cdk1, allowing the exchange of Cdc20 by Cdh1 in the APC/C-UBE2C complex, which becomes activated. The activated complex degrades securin, allowing separase to be activated and degrade the cohesin rings of sister chromatids. This leads to anaphase onset and mitotic exit.",
  "figure_2": "Impact of UBE2C dysregulation in cancer cells. High UBE2C levels are associated with chromosome instability/aneuploidy, increased proliferation, invasion, and migration, EMT, reduced apoptosis, autophagy inhibition, stem-like properties, dissemination, and therapy resistance, leading to poor patient survival in several malignancies."
