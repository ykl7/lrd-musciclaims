      "caption": "Overview of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Calcium homeostasis is maintained by the influx and efflux of Ca2+ through calcium channels and pumps located on the plasma membrane, as well as membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and endo-lysosomes. The cytoplasm, extracellular space, and each organelle have unique resting Ca2+ concentrations that have been indicated. Extracellular Ca2+ is transported into the cytosol through different channels such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, purinergic receptor (P2X) channels, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) channels, Piezo mechanosensitive channels, ionotropic glutamate receptor channels (e.g. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, NMDARs), and voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels. Ca2+ is removed from the cytosol to the extracellular space by plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) efflux pumps and sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX). Activation of cell surface transmembrane receptors with tyrosine-based activation motifs (RTK e.g. B-cell and T-cell receptors) or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR e.g. neurokinin-1 receptor) activate phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) located in the plasma membrane which generates two second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the ER membrane leading to the release of Ca2+ from the ER and DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). Depletion of ER Ca2+ activates stromal interaction molecules STIM1-STIM2 (located in the ER membrane), which then activates Orai1-Orai3 channels (located in the plasma membrane) to induce Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. This mechanism is called store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Ryanodine receptors (RYRs) represent an alternative pathway for Ca2+ release from the ER regulated by Ca2+, Mg2+ and other molecules including ATP, calmodulin and CaMKII. The Ca2+ concentration in the ER is replenished via sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) pump. The influx of Ca2+ from the ER to mitochondria occurs through voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) and mitochondrial calcium uniport (MCU) located in high numbers within mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) (insert a). Ca2+ leaves mitochondria mostly through Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger (NCLX). Ca2+ stored in the endo-lysosomes is mobilized mostly by two-pore channels (TPC) and transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) channels in response to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP.) TRPML1 is involved in the mitochondrial-lysosomal contact sites (Mit-Lys), facilitating Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria through VDAC and MCU (insert b). Multiple effector molecules mediate effects of Ca2+ signaling including PKC, Raf-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), calmodulin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (e.g. CaMKII), and calcineurin. These signaling molecules influence gene expression through transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT).",

      "caption": "Mechanisms and consequences of deregulated calcium signaling in red cells and erythroid precursors. (A) In hereditary stomatocytosis/xerocytosis, heterogenous gain-of-function mutations in the Piezo1 or Gárdos channels cause excessive Ca2+ entry into red blood cells (RBCs). In sickle cell disease, there is an abnormally high abundance and activity of NMDA receptor channels, and probably other Ca2+-transporting ion channels contributing to the increased permeability of the RBC membrane to Ca2+. A layer of aggregated hemoglobin S (HbS) interferes with the shedding of NMDA receptor channels from the cell surface. Reduced levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) impair the function of the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA); as a result, Ca2+ uptake exceeds its efflux. Excess intracellular Ca2+ can be sequestered into vesicles and extruded, protecting the cytosolic and membrane proteins from Ca2+-induced damage. However, over time, increased cytosolic Ca2+ overactivates the Gárdos channel leading to cell dehydration. Membrane and cytoskeletal instability are induced by the overactive calcium/calmodulin (CaM) complexes, calpain, or scramblase (Scr). This leads to premature RBC clearance, hemolysis, and anemia. The exact contribution of these mechanisms to different types of anemia remains under investigation. (B) Effects of high intracellular Ca2+ in polycythemia vera (PV). Hyperactive JAK2 V617F mutation increases Ca2+ levels in erythroid precursors. Ca2+ overload impairs the nuclear export function of calreticulin (CALR), which results in nuclear retention of the glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα) responsible for stress response and erythroid proliferation. Defective organelle sorting and extrusion from erythroblasts leaves organellar remnants in reticulocytes.",

NMDA receptor directly facilitates Ca2+ entry into cells but may also operate in a metabotropic manner to induce Ca2+ release from the ER or via secondary messenger activation of ion channels such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and glutamate are both released from maturing megakaryocytes. ADP binds G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and activates PLC-β to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. NMDA receptor modulates GPCR function in neuronal cells, so potentially may do so in hematopoietic cells. (B) Overview of NMDA receptor-associated effects in megakaryocytes. NMDA receptor assists proplatelet formation by regulating the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) elements (e.g. collagen) and ECM remodeling enzymes (e.g. lysyl oxidase, LOX and matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs).

      "caption": "Oncogenic effects of calcineurin and calreticulin. (A) The role of calcineurin-NFAT signaling in the pathogenesis of myeloid proliferation associated with Down syndrome. Human chromosome 21 encodes two important regulators of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) - regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). When calcineurin is activated by Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM), it dephosphorylates NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT translocates to the nucleus and transcriptionally regulates numerous genes involved in cell proliferation, growth, migration, differentiation, and survival. NFAT is re-phosphorylated by DYRK1A and is exported back to the cytoplasm. RCAN1 inhibits calcineurin, and so also inhibits the dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. RCAN1 and DYRK1A are overexpressed in Down syndrome and are suspected to contribute to the development of transient abnormal myeloproliferation and megakaryoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome children. (B) The role of mutated calreticulin (CALR) in myeloproliferative neoplasms. More than 50 mutations have been reported in exon 9 of the CALR gene; most generate a +1-frameshift causing the mutated CALR protein (mCALR) to stably associate with the thrombopoietin receptor MPL protein in the ER. The mCALR-MPL complex is transported from the ER through the Golgi apparatus and secretory system to the plasma membrane. The binding of mCALR to MPL constitutively activates signaling through JAK2 and its downstream targets such as STAT, AKT, and ERK (left). The most common mCALR variants are type 1 that also impair the Ca2+ binding activity of mCALR more than type 2. The type 1 mCALR with reduced Ca2+ binding dissociates from STIM1 in the ER. This allows STIM1 to dimerize and bind Orai1 and TRPC, which leads to constitutive activation of SOCE (right).",

Examples of mechanisms responsible for the remodeling of Ca2+ signaling in blood cancer are depicted within the central blue circle. Their direct consequences are listed in the middle red circle, and therapeutic opportunities arising from these changes are highlighted in the outer green circle. For example, the increased expression of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (a mechanism of remodeling) leads to increased extracellular Ca2+ influx supporting oncogenic signaling (a consequence). Such changes could be counteracted by specific Ca2+ channel inhibitors (a therapeutic opportunity). In another example, mechanisms that spare cancer cells from mitochondrial Ca2+ overload (e.g. through the overexpression of Bcl-2 or VDAC) could be counteracted by inhibitors of these molecules. The design of novel therapies heavily relies on our understanding of the Ca2+-toolkit remodeling in different blood cancers.",
