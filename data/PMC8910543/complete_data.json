      "caption": "Antitumoral activity of the antidiabetic biguanide metformin. Metformin may affect tumorigenesis by acting on different hallmarks of cancer (angiogenesis, cell growth and proliferation, glucose metabolism, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell cycle progression, DNA damage or inflammation). These effects may be led by a direct (insulin-independent) effect mediated by the activation of AMPK. Metformin also has an indirect (insulin-dependent) effect, in which metformin reduces insulin levels. This leads to a decrease in blood glucose by limiting gluconeogenesis and increasing glycogenolysis in the liver, promoting growth hormone synthesis, reducing the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and stimulating lipogenesis, as well as fostering glycogenesis, protein synthesis, and glucose utilization in the muscle.",

      "caption": "Antiproliferative effects of metformin on breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of metformin in breast cancer is partly attributed to its ability to reduce insulin/IGF1 levels, which inhibits the molecular pathways mediated by them that support tumor initiation and progression (indirect or insulin-dependent mechanism, represented via red lines ˗ ˗ ˗I). Metformin is transported into the cell via the organic cation transporters (OCTs), which support the intracellular accumulation of metformin. On the contrary, the transporters’ multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) expel metformin from the cell. Inside the cell, metformin directly activates AMPK and the ‘AMPK dependent’ effects (direct or insulin-independent effects, which are represented via black lines ˗ ˗ ˗I). This process includes the inhibition of IRS1 phosphorylation and blocking of MAPK and mTOR, among other pathways. Metformin is also known to inhibit mitochondrial Complex 1 of the electron transport chain, which reduces ATP levels and increases the AMP/ATP ratio, leading to further AMPK activation.",
