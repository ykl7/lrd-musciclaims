      "caption": "Disease-specific antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titers measured at 1 and 3 months after initial COVID-19 vaccination grouped by disease subtype and summarized using scatter plots with median and interquartile range. Note: “1 month” time point = 3 weeks from the first BNT162b2 vaccine and 4 weeks from the first mRNA-1273 vaccine. A, Patients with leukemia (Leuk), lymphoma (Lymph), and multiple myeloma (MM). mo, month. B, Patients with leukemia on observation (Obs) and patients receiving BTK inhibitors (BTKi), venetoclax (ven), and other therapies. C, Patients with lymphoma on Obs and patients receiving BTKi, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, anti-CD19/CD20–directed therapies (αCD19/20), and other therapies. D, Patients with multiple myeloma on Obs and patients receiving immunomodulatory agents (IMiD), anti-CD38–directed therapy (αCD38), anti–B-cell maturation antigen-directed therapies (αBCMA), and other therapies. For all plots, green dashed line denotes the threshold for a positive result (50.0 AU/mL), orange dashed line denotes the median value at 1 month for healthy controls (886 AU/mL), and red dashed line denotes the median value at 3 months for healthy controls (7,720 AU/mL). n = number of individuals per category.",
