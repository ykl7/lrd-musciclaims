  "figure_6": "In vivo construction of immune cell-based nanomedicine carriers and initial PTT treatment enhance hitchhiking delivery into the tumor and improve antitumor immunotherapy. A E. coli OMVs are coated on both CD-GNPs and ADA-GNPs to prepare bacteria-mimetic nanoparticles. B Selective phagocytosis of bacteria-mimetic nanoparticles by phagocytic immune cells induces OMV degradation and subsequent intracellular aggregation of GNPs mediated by CD-ADA host–guest interactions, leading to photothermal property due to the plasmonic effects of GNP aggregates. The large size of intracellular GNP aggregates also inhibits the leakage during in vivo cell-hitchhiking delivery. Because of the inflammatory tropism to melanoma, immune cells achieve the targeted delivery of intracellular GNP aggregates to the tumor tissues. C Initial PTT treatment of GNP aggregates induces tumor damage that subsequently enhances inflammatory signals and provides positive feedback to recruit more immune cells (including the carriers) for enhanced antitumor therapy. Secondary photothermal treatment (PTT) of Mixture induces tumor cell immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activates antitumor immune response, further strengthened by immune checkpoint blockage (aPD-L1), reproduced with permission from [168], licensed under CC BY 4.0",

Part II: Topical application of SHP/SiRNA induces survivin slicing in skin melanoma. (1) SHP/SiRNA nanocomplexes penetrate through the skin stratum corneum and target to melanoma locates at the interface of epidermis and dermis. (2) SHP/SiRNA-survivin nanocomplexes are uptaken by melanoma cells. (3) SHP/SiRNAsurvivin nanocomplexes escaped from the lysosome, release the siRNA that bind to the targeting RNA, followed by slicing survivin, which possesses the great potential to induce the significant apoptosis to melanoma cells in vitro and retard the melanoma progression in vivo, reproduced with permission from [249], copyright 2020, Elsevier",

B Combination immunotherapy induced by P/LNV@IDO/AE/CpG. Naive dendritic cells (DCs) are activated and their maturation is induced by the antigens delivered by P/LNV@IDO/AE/CpG, which then present the processed peptide antigens to T cells, causing a strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. Tumor cells would be attacked by effector T cells. Besides, the presentation of 1-MT would inhibit the activity of IDO by decreasing the oxidization of tryptophan (Trp) to kynurenine (Krn), which further enhanced the antitumor immune response. Together, P/LNV@IDO/AE/CpG resulted in a superior combination immunotherapy against melanoma, reproduced with permission from [334], copyright 2021, Royal Society of Chemistry",
