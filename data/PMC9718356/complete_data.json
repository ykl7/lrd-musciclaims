      "caption": "(panels A-D). Airport-related ultrafine particle (UFP) exposure estimates (particles/cm3; see Methods) for a 53 × 43 kilometer grid area around the Los Angeles International Airport (1993–2013). Natural breaks were used to classify five UFP exposure categories displayed in gradations of red. For privacy reasons, residential locations of MEC participants at baseline (1993–1996) were randomly offset up to 350 meters for: a) African Americans (n=25,398), b) Japanese Americans (n=9,532), c) Latin Americans (n=31,568), and d) European Americans (n=9,328). The impact UFP zone was defined as an oval with an aspect ratio of 2:1 aligned along with the orientation of the airport runways and predominate daytime wind direction, with one, long-axis edge aligned with the upwind airport property line. The long axis represented the distribution of maximum centerline UFP concentrations for all the July months between 1993 and 2013, while the impact zone encompassed a subset of subjects with higher exposures than the modeled grid. The major axis length was extended until centerline maximum UFP concentrations decreased to 1,500 particles/cm3. The natural breaks were used to facilitate the visualization of UFP number concentrations that had a highly right-skewed distribution.",
