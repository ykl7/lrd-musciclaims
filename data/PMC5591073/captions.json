  "figure_1": "Characteristics of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) mutations identified in the cohort. A. Number of mutations harbored per patient. B. Density of mutations by variant allele fraction in blood and tumor tissue C. Patterns of mutation co-occurrence and number of patients with mutations in ten most recurrently mutated genes. The first 1912 patients in the cohort underwent sequencing with a 341-gene assay, which did not include PPM1D but included all other genes listed. The remaining patients (N=6,898) underwent sequencing with a 410-gene assay, which included all genes shown. D. Distribution of DNMT3A mutations within cohort. Gene models are based on uniprot database. E. Distribution of PPM1D mutations within cohort. F. CH association with age and age distribution of patients in cohort.",
  "figure_3": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and clonal hematopoiesis in presumptive drivers (CH-PD) and associations with subsequent hematologic cancers and overall survival. A. Incidence of new hematologic cancer for patients with and without CH. B. Incidence of new hematologic cancer for patients with and without CH-PD. C. OS in non-CH vs. CH, all ages. Time-point estimates for non-CH vs. CH are 12-month OS: 0.70 (0.68–0.73) vs. 0.74 (0.73–0.76); 18-month OS: 0.57 (0.54–0.60) vs. 0.64 (0.62–0.66); and 24-month OS: 0.50 (0.46–0.53) vs. 0.55 (0.53–0.57). D. OS in non-CH-PD vs. CH-PD, all ages. Time-point estimates for non-CH-PD vs. CH-PD are 12-month OS: 0.67 (0.62 vs. 0.74) vs. 0.74 (0.72–0.75); 18-month OS: 0.55 (0.49–0.63) vs. 0.63 (0.61–0.64); and 24-month OS: 0.48 (0.40–0.57) vs. 0.54 (0.52–0.56). Differences in the incidence of new hematologic cancer were compared using Gray’s test, while survival differences were assessed using the Peto & Peto modification of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test. Survival was compared both overall and stratified based on categories of age, gender, and smoking status."
