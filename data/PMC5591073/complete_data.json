The first 1912 patients in the cohort underwent sequencing with a 341-gene assay, which did not include PPM1D but included all other genes listed. The remaining patients (N=6,898) underwent sequencing with a 410-gene assay, which included all genes shown. D. Distribution of DNMT3A mutations within cohort. Gene models are based on uniprot database. E. Distribution of PPM1D mutations within cohort. F. CH association with age and age distribution of patients in cohort.",
