  "figure_5": "Scheme illustration of the neurotropism, neuroinflammatory processes, BBB leakage and effects on different brain cells triggered by COVID-19 in patients. (A) Immune cells from the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) produce effector molecules that include pro-inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies. (B) SARS-CoV-2 infection also causes leakage of the blood–brain barrier leading in some cases to hemorrhage and cerebral infarct, as well as eliciting leukocytes infiltration. (C) In the parenchyma, the CNS cells become infected by SARS-CoV via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) endocytosis mediated by the two-pore channel 2 (TCP2). (D) SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to loss of physiological functions of the brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, pericytes and oligodendrocytes. Cell types are identified in the following manner; A, Astrocyte; L, Leukocyte; M, Microglia; N, Neuron; O, Oligodendrocyte; P, pericyte.
