  "figure_5": "Timeline of breast cancer organoid culture progress. From left to right, the timeline depicts five different years and progress in culturing breast cancer organoids. Bissell and colleagues pioneered the 3D culturing technique in the 1980s. In 2013, Drose and associates cultivated the first patient-derived breast cancer organoid. In 2015, Zubeldia-Plazaola and colleagues discovered that slow digestion at low enzyme concentrations significantly enhanced the success rate of organoid culturing. In 2016, Zhang and co-workers successfully constructed a breast organoid. In 2018, Sachs and associates discovered the effect of neuregulin-1 and Wnt-3A on organoid growth, further developing organoid technology.",
  "figure_6": "Application of breast cancer organoids. The current applications of breast cancer-like organs involve four main areas. The first is drug screening, where patient-derived breast cancer cells are cultured into organoids that then undergo in vitro drug screening, allowing for targeted therapy. The second area is the establishment of breast cancer organoid biobanks. In the third and fourth areas, organoid-level research on tumor mechanisms and gene editing can be conducted."
