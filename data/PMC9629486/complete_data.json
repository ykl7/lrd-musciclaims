Isodose distribution for a recurrent right parietal brain metastasis treated with resection and GT Cs-131 brachytherapy: Alternative external beam radiotherapy approaches, such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery, CyberKnife radiosurgery, and intensity-modulated proton therapy are illustrated to demonstrate the differences in isodose distribution amongst the radiotherapy modalities. All plans were normalized to cover the same target volume with an EQD2 of 60Gy. A prospective comparative study is critical to understanding the clinical outcomes with each of these approaches.",
