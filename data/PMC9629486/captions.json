  "figure_1": "Comparison of GT STaRT to other radiation modalities. Isodose distribution for a recurrent right parietal brain metastasis treated with resection and GT Cs-131 brachytherapy: Alternative external beam radiotherapy approaches, such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery, CyberKnife radiosurgery, and intensity-modulated proton therapy are illustrated to demonstrate the differences in isodose distribution amongst the radiotherapy modalities. All plans were normalized to cover the same target volume with an EQD2 of 60Gy. A prospective comparative study is critical to understanding the clinical outcomes with each of these approaches.",
  "figure_2": "GT STaRT seed placement and resulting Isodose distribution. Patient with a recurrent left parietal brain metastasis after prior whole-brain radiotherapy treated with resection and GT Cs-131 brachytherapy: The figure illustrates the placement of 6 seeds, each with an individual source strength of 3.5U (5.49mCi), to a cumulative seed strength of 21U (32.94mCi). Axial, sagittal, and coronal images of the postimplant CT of the brain demonstrate the resulting isodose distribution of this implant to a prescription dose of 60 Gy."
