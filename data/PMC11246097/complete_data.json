Relative peripheral myopia between (c) and (d) first increases, then decreases, with field angle primarily owing to the oblate profile of retina (d).

(B and C) Relative peripheral defocus along the horizontal field meridian calculated using either second-order or second-, fourth-, and sixth-order Zernikes (Appendix D); (E and F) use the latter calculation.
