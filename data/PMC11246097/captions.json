  "figure_1": "Coordinate system of a right eye used in the models. The anatomical elements of the model eye are separated axially for illustration purposes. The global x and y axes are drawn at each surface with solid lines. The line joining the center of the pupil to the center of the retina defines a reference axis (equivalent to the optical axis in a coaxial system). Translations, tilts, and rotations of the cornea and lens are made relative to this reference axis. The local x and y axes relative to the corneal center and the lens center are drawn with dashed lines. The illustrated lens has a second set of axes with shorter dashes to indicate an arbitrary upward pitch of +10°.",
  "figure_3": "Total root mean square (RMS) wavefront error, where lower values are better, for a 4 mm pupil diameter. (A and B) Sections along the horizontal visual field for (A) emmetropic and (B) myopic eye models. Error bars around the cohort traces are ±1 standard deviation. (C, D, and E) Total RMS wavefront error across the 80° × 50° field of the models. At fixation (zero in the horizontal and vertical fields), the emmetropic eyes have less total aberration than the myopic eyes, predominantly owing to lower-order refractive error. Changes in total aberrations with increasing field angle are generally greater (steeper contour to the plots and surfaces) for the emmetropic models than the myopic models.",
  "figure_4": "Strehl ratio, where larger values mean better optical quality, across the 80° × 50° field for (A) the ideal emmetropic model, (B) the typical emmetropic eye model, and (C) the pooled average of all 28 eyes in the emmetropic cohort. Across all models best optical quality is found centrally and decreases essentially monotonically away from fixation. The excellent optical quality of the ideal emmetropic eye relative to the typical and individual models is obvious. Uncorrected myopic eye models (not shown) are considerably defocused at the fovea and across the field, which results in low and meaningless Strehl ratios (Smith, 2000). These myopic models are discussed again when ophthalmic correction modalities are illustrated.",
  "figure_5": "Individual Zernike aberration terms of the ideal emmetropic and typical emmetropic eye models as function of visual field angle for a 4 mm pupil diameter. Increase in the magnitudes of (A and D) second-order astigmatism (Zernike sine term C3 shown), (B and E) third-order coma (Zernike cosine term C8 shown), and (C and F) fourth-order spherical aberration (Zernike term C12) were approximately quadratic, linear, and constant with field angle, respectively. Small deviations from (A and D) quadratic, (B and E) linear, and (C and F) constant behaviors predicted by Seidel aberration theory are due to our modeling using aspheric surfaces and allowing tilts and decentrations of optical elements.",
  "figure_6": "Defocus and relative defocus for a 4 mm pupil diameter. (A) The relative locations of the hypothetical optical image shells (a, c, e) and retinal shapes (b, d) determine relative peripheral defocus. Image shell (c) is foveally emmetropic for both retinas (b) and (d), but is peripherally hyperopic relative to retina (b) and peripherally myopic relative to retina (d). Relative peripheral myopia between (c) and (d) first increases, then decreases, with field angle primarily owing to the oblate profile of retina (d). This is the reason for the recoiling patterns in the far periphery of the cohort curves in (B) and (C). (B and C) Relative peripheral defocus along the horizontal field meridian calculated using either second-order or second-, fourth-, and sixth-order Zernikes (Appendix D); (E and F) use the latter calculation. (D and E) Relative peripheral defocus is essentially the same as actual defocus for the ideal emmetropic and typical emmetropic models because foveal dioptric defocus is +0.005 D and −0.023 D, respectively. (F) Relative (upper) and actual (lower) defocus surfaces for the −2.75 D myopic eye model are offset from each other by 2.761 D of foveal myopic defocus. Like total root mean square wavefront error in Figure 3, the relative change in defocus with field angle is greater (steeper plots and surfaces) for emmetropic eye models than for the myopic model.",
  "figure_7": "Foveal and peripheral longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) (D) calculated using second-, fourth- and sixth-order Zernikes (Appendix D). (A) Foveal LCA of all emmetropic and myopic eye models fell within typical ranges (Bedford & Wyszecki, 1957) and near to a population model (Atchison & Smith, 2005). Error bars are 1 standard deviation. (B) Dioptric differences as a function of wavelength for fixation and eight locations in the nasal horizontal field of the typical emmetropic model; legend for (B) is as in (C). In (B), curves for eccentricities 0° through 15° coincide and the vertical offset of the other curves is primarily owing to relative peripheral defocus described above. (C) Subtracting the foveal defocus value of a curve at 589 nm from all values in that curve (relative peripheral defocus) shows that relative LCA is consistent as a function of field angle.",
  "figure_8": "Transverse chromatic aberration (TCA), where positive horizontal and vertical TCA mean that shorter wavelengths are more nasal and inferior on the retina than longer wavelengths, respectively. (A) TCA between 842 and 543 nm increases in magnitude with increasing field angle away from the fovea. (B) General model of TCA: optical models are not limited to discrete wavelengths. Each curve shows a different eccentricity, where the TCA between any wavelengths at any eccentricity can be calculated. (C) Foveal TCA between 842 and 543 nm for all individual and representative eye models.",
  "figure_9": "The effects of changing pupil size and position. (A) The inclusion of fourth- and sixth-order spherical aberrations, results in much more consistent refractive behavior across pupil sizes (Charman et al., 1978) than when only using the second-order Zernike term. (B) Predicted changes in transverse chromatic aberration that could result from a misalignment of the effective 4-mm diameter pupil, such as due to an improperly positioned corneal inlay or a misaligned projected psychophysical stimulus beam. The zero-offset curve is the same as the corresponding one in Figure 8A between 842 and 543 nm. Other curves are for horizontal offsets in the effective pupil position ranging from −4 mm to +4 mm, where negative offsets mean nasal offsets of the pupil relative to eye.",
  "figure_11": "Optical results of accommodation. (A) Accommodative responses (relative to the distance vision dioptric error) at the fovea for demands between 0 and 6 D. Lags or leads are the differences between a plot and the demand (unity) line. Lags are positive differences, leads are negative. The legend for (A) and (B) is below (A). (B) Zernike spherical aberration (C12) becomes relatively more negative with accommodation, in agreement with literature. (C) Relative peripheral defocus across the horizontal field meridian removes the foveal lag of accommodation and reveals peripheral hyperopia with increasing accommodation. Demands are labeled in the legend. (D) Actual accommodation (not relative as in [C]) across the field for all demands. All objects were flat surfaces at 1/demand from the cornea."
