  "figure_2": "Schematic representation of the BBB. Endothelial cells are made which are tightly attached via tight junctions. Blood vessels, and mural cells including vascular smooth muscle cells and PCs, are placed on the outer layer. The PCs have incompletely covered the abluminal microvascular side that is attached to the vascular basement membrane. Astrocytes are polarized glial cell types, cover the entire vessel’s tube.\nAbbreviations: BBB, blood–brain barrier; PCs, pericytes.",
  "figure_3": "Nanocarrier and brain delivery. Various types of nanocarriers including inorganic nanoparticles, dendrimers, SLNs, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, exosomes, minicells, and liposomes encounter 4 types of transport mechanisms including transcellular, receptor-mediated, paracellular, and carrier-mediated transport to pass through BBB.\nAbbreviations: BBB, blood–brain barrier; SLNs, solid lipid nanoparticles."
