      "caption": "Developing cancer vaccines for glioblastoma patients in clinical trials follows a structured process designed to stimulate an immune response. In addition to conventional administration routes, such as intramuscular, subcutaneous, or injection into the post-surgical tumor cavity, some approaches involve a more complex preparation process. It begins with harvesting a tumor sample during surgery, from which cancer cells are isolated or processed into a tumor lysate rich in tumor-specific antigens. Simultaneously, white blood cells are collected from the patient and differentiated into antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically DCs. Tumor antigens are thus either loaded onto DCs or fused with them to create hybrid DCs capable of effectively presenting tumor-associated antigens ex vivo. Once activated, these DCs are reintroduced into the patient as a vaccine, aiming to trigger a robust immune response against the tumor.",

These cells present the processed antigens on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to immune effectors, including natural killer (NK) cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The activated T cells proliferate and secrete cytokines, thereby amplifying the immune response by recruiting additional immune cells, such as M1 macrophages and B cells. These activated immune cells circulate throughout the body, seeking out and attacking tumor cells. However, glioblastoma presents significant challenges, such as the BBB and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which limit immune cell infiltration and function, ultimately contributing to immune evasion and continued tumor growth.",

Glioblastoma poses a challenge for immunotherapy due to its limited immunogenicity, primarily affected by the BBB and the immunosuppressive TME. The BBB restricts the entry of therapeutic agents into the brain, making it challenging to deliver immunotherapy to the tumor site. Additionally, the TME organizes an immunosuppressive environment, protecting GSCs from recognition and immune attack. They also often mimic their antigens, avoiding detection and removal by the immune system. Moreover, they recruit immunosuppressive cells, such as MDSCs and Treg cells, and secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, which inhibit the activation and function of immune cells.",
