This figure illustrates a personalized treatment framework that integrates diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with breast cancer, regardless of metastasis presence. Tissue and blood samples are analyzed with immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multi-omics approaches (genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics), and liquid biopsy techniques (ctDNA/CTCs). Molecular imaging is used to visualize tumor markers, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) aids in data interpretation and decision-making. On the basis of the molecular subtypes, personalized therapies are tailored, including endocrine therapies with or without CDK4/6 inhibitors for HR+/HER2− tumors, HER2-targeted therapies (e.g., trastuzumab) for HER2+ tumors, ChT or immunotherapy for TNBC, and innovative cell/mRNA-based therapies.",
