Hetero- or homo-oligomerized receptor chains specifically engage a member of the JAK kinases in order to form signaling-competent hematopoietic receptor complexes. Myelopoiesis is driven by cytokines whose receptors signal through the transactivation of a pair of juxtaposed JAK2 molecules. Lymphopoiesis is mostly driven by interleukins that bind to the shared γc-receptor family, which signals through the cooperative action of JAK1 and JAK3. JAK2 and JAK1 participate in the signaling of TSLP, a cytokine involved in late development of B-lymphocytes. JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 can work as partners whereas JAK3 works exclusively in concert with JAK1. JAK2 is the only family member that can function with itself as opposing JAK.

The overall frequency (i.e. the sum of the individual mutation frequencies for each component among the different references) is indicated in yellow while the absolute contributions of each are detailed using a specific color code (yellow for JAK1, orange for JAK2, green for JAK3, turquoise for TYK2, pink for cytokine receptors, black for STAT3, red for STAT5b and gray for STAT6). Schematic protein representations are used to localize the identified point mutations with the affected functional domains indicated in red.
