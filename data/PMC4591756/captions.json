  "figure_1": "Hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis originates from a hematopoietic stem cell, which can undergo either self-renewal or hierarchical differentiation into lineage-committed progenitors with decreasing potential that ultimately will give rise to all mature blood cells. Cytokines and their receptor-associated JAK necessary for the progenitors to pass through the different maturation steps are indicated. HSC: hematopoietic stem cell; CMP: common myeloid progenitor; CLP: common lymphoid progenitor; GM: granulocyte macrophage progenitor; BCP: B cell progenitor; TNK: T and natural killer cell progenitor; EP: erythroid progenitor; Mk: megakaryocyte; GP: granulocyte progenitor; MP: macrophage progenitor; TPO: thrombopoietin; SCF: stem cell factor; IL: interleukin; GM-CSF: granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; M-CSF: monocyte colony-stimulating factor; TSLP: thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin.",
  "figure_2": "Hematopoietic cytokine-receptor complexes. Hetero- or homo-oligomerized receptor chains specifically engage a member of the JAK kinases in order to form signaling-competent hematopoietic receptor complexes. Myelopoiesis is driven by cytokines whose receptors signal through the transactivation of a pair of juxtaposed JAK2 molecules. Lymphopoiesis is mostly driven by interleukins that bind to the shared γc-receptor family, which signals through the cooperative action of JAK1 and JAK3. JAK2 and JAK1 participate in the signaling of TSLP, a cytokine involved in late development of B-lymphocytes. JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 can work as partners whereas JAK3 works exclusively in concert with JAK1. JAK2 is the only family member that can function with itself as opposing JAK. EPO: erythropoietin; TPO: thrombopoietin; G-CSF: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; IL: interleukin; GM-CSF: granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor; TSLP: thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin.",
  "figure_3": "Frequencies of genetic alterations affecting the receptor-JAK-STAT axis among hematologic malignancies. Diagrams give an overview of the maximal overall frequency of cases with genetic alterations of the receptor-JAK-STAT axis in (A) myeloid lineage, (B) lymphoid progenitors and (C) lymphoid mature cells disorders (see next page). The overall frequency (i.e. the sum of the individual mutation frequencies for each component among the different references) is indicated in yellow while the absolute contributions of each are detailed using a specific color code (yellow for JAK1, orange for JAK2, green for JAK3, turquoise for TYK2, pink for cytokine receptors, black for STAT3, red for STAT5b and gray for STAT6). Schematic protein representations are used to localize the identified point mutations with the affected functional domains indicated in red. In some cases, other genetic lesions and clinical associations are described. MPN: myeloproliferative neoplasms; PV: polycythemia vera; ET: essential thrombocythemia; MF: myelofibrosis; CNL: chronic neutrophilic leukemia; CML: chronic myeloid leukemia; JMML: juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia; AMKL: acute megakaryoblastic leukemia; ALL: acute lymphoblastic leukemia; DS: Down-syndrome; T-PLL: T-prolymphocytic leukemia; ATLL: adult T-cell lymphoma; NKTCL: NK/T-cell lymphoma; NK- and T-LGL: NK-and T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia; PMBL: primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma; HL: Hodgkin lymphoma. For abbreviations and explanations see footnote.",
  "figure_4": "Mechanisms of constitutive JAK-STAT pathway activation in hematologic malignancies. The molecular mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway are depicted and can affect all the components of the cascade (receptors, JAK, STAT, negative regulators). They can result from small nucleotide sequence modifications (mutations, insertions, deletions) or larger changes at the chromosomal level (translocations and epigenetic changes)."
