      "caption": "(A) The clinical “optic disc” and “peripapillary” regions are defined relative to the clinical disc margin (see Supplemental Figure 1). (B) We propose that OCT examination of the ONH tissues should be organized relative to the OCT-detected Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO) and neural canal. (C) OCT-radial B-scan from the location depicted by the green line in Panel B. (D) We define the neural canal to be the connective tissue pathway through the choroid and sclera through which the RGC axon bundles achieve the retrolaminar orbital optic nerve. The pre-scleral neural canal extends from BMO, to the anterior scleral canal opening, (ASCO) and is lined by the choroidal border tissues (CBT) of Elschnig. The scleral portion of the neural canal extends from the ASCO through the scleral flange opening (SFO) (when present) and ends at the posterior scleral canal opening which is, at present, inconsistently visualized by OCT. ONH neural canal tissues are contained within the neural canal and ONH pNC tissues are peripheral, (but immediately adjacent to), BMO and the neural canal wall. We propose these terms so as to distinguish OCT ONH anatomic terminology from the clinical terms optic disc, papilla, and peri-papillary which have no consistent histologic or OCT-detectable anatomic foundation.

(A2 - C2) The scleral flange histologically refers to the peri-neural canal (pNC) sclera that is “central “or “internal” to the dural sheath insertion. The dural sheath adds substantial thickness to the outer layers of the posterior sclera. The potential thinness of the scleral flange relative to the adjacent posterior sclera may have important biomechanical implications on the flow of blood within the posterior ciliary arteries which pass through the scleral flange to achieve the juxta canalicular choroid as well as the lamina cribrosa. The anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) is histologically defined to be the projection of the anterior scleral flange surface through the choroidal border tissues (CBT). The posterior scleral canal opening has been described histologically and using 3D histomorphometry (see Introduction) but is not consistently visualized in OCT imaging and is shown here for representation purposes only. For this study the scleral flange opening (SFO) was manually segmented either “geometrically” when identifiable (Panels B2 and C2, see Methods) or, when not geometrically identifiable, estimated visually by projecting the anterior laminar surface through the neural canal wall (Panel A2, see methods). (A3 – C3) Existing BMO and ASCO segmentations in combination with the segmented SFO points were used to define the externally oblique CBT (EOCBT) and Exposed Scleral Flange (ESF) which were parameterized within BMO reference plane as shown in Figure 5.",

Unlike the anterior and internal surfaces which can be histologically defined, the posterior scleral flange “surface” and “peripheral” extent of the scleral flange cannot be histologically determined and should be considered a biological continuum. We define the neural canal to extend from BMO through the posterior scleral canal opening (PSCO) with a variable transition into the orbital pial sheath. (C) In this study, measurement of the exposed neural canal (ENC), externally oblique choroidal border tissue (EOCBT), and the exposed scleral flange (ESF) regions was performed after projection of all segmented BMO, ASCO and SFO points to the BMO reference plane (see methods). (D) Projecting Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO), anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) and scleral flange opening (SFO) points to the BMO reference plane allows EOCBT and ESF measurements to be made relative to the Foveal to BMO centroid (FoBMO) axis and FoBMO 30° sectors.
