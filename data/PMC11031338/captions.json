  "figure_1": "(A) The clinical “optic disc” and “peripapillary” regions are defined relative to the clinical disc margin (see Supplemental Figure 1). (B) We propose that OCT examination of the ONH tissues should be organized relative to the OCT-detected Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO) and neural canal. (C) OCT-radial B-scan from the location depicted by the green line in Panel B. (D) We define the neural canal to be the connective tissue pathway through the choroid and sclera through which the RGC axon bundles achieve the retrolaminar orbital optic nerve. The pre-scleral neural canal extends from BMO, to the anterior scleral canal opening, (ASCO) and is lined by the choroidal border tissues (CBT) of Elschnig. The scleral portion of the neural canal extends from the ASCO through the scleral flange opening (SFO) (when present) and ends at the posterior scleral canal opening which is, at present, inconsistently visualized by OCT. ONH neural canal tissues are contained within the neural canal and ONH pNC tissues are peripheral, (but immediately adjacent to), BMO and the neural canal wall. We propose these terms so as to distinguish OCT ONH anatomic terminology from the clinical terms optic disc, papilla, and peri-papillary which have no consistent histologic or OCT-detectable anatomic foundation. (see Supplemental Figure 1)",
  "figure_2": "(A1 – C1) Three OCT-radial B-scan from three representative eyes (FDA165 (A1) top, FDA261 (B1) middle, and Hi-Myo-GL-29, (C1) bottom). (A2 - C2) The scleral flange histologically refers to the peri-neural canal (pNC) sclera that is “central “or “internal” to the dural sheath insertion. The dural sheath adds substantial thickness to the outer layers of the posterior sclera. The potential thinness of the scleral flange relative to the adjacent posterior sclera may have important biomechanical implications on the flow of blood within the posterior ciliary arteries which pass through the scleral flange to achieve the juxta canalicular choroid as well as the lamina cribrosa. The anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) is histologically defined to be the projection of the anterior scleral flange surface through the choroidal border tissues (CBT). The posterior scleral canal opening has been described histologically and using 3D histomorphometry (see Introduction) but is not consistently visualized in OCT imaging and is shown here for representation purposes only. For this study the scleral flange opening (SFO) was manually segmented either “geometrically” when identifiable (Panels B2 and C2, see Methods) or, when not geometrically identifiable, estimated visually by projecting the anterior laminar surface through the neural canal wall (Panel A2, see methods). (A3 – C3) Existing BMO and ASCO segmentations in combination with the segmented SFO points were used to define the externally oblique CBT (EOCBT) and Exposed Scleral Flange (ESF) which were parameterized within BMO reference plane as shown in Figure 5.",

(A4-F4) Pertinent ENC region and EOCBT and ESF sub-region segmentations. We define an EOCBT region to be internal to BMO extending to the ASCO which defines the CBT insertion into the scleral flange. We define an ESF region to extend from the ASCO to the SFO and to be devoid of overlying choroid and/or Bruch’s membrane. (A1-A4) Study eye FDA124 does not demonstrate an ENC region because the CBTs are internally oblique in all ONH segments. ((A1)-(C4)) Panels A - C show three non-highly myopic eyes with their increasing ENC regions by radial and sectoral extent. The ENC region of each eye contains both EOCBT and ESF sub-regions. ((D1)-(F4)) Panel D - F show three highly myopic eyes with their increasing ENC regions by radial and sectoral extent, in which the ESF and/or EOCBT region is even further elongated. All eyes are shown in right eye orientation.",
  "figure_3": "(A) Pre-scleral and scleral flange neural canal anatomy projected onto the fundus photo of study eye Hi-Myo-GL-29, (also shown in Figure 1). Here the OCT ENC region is longest temporally, and extends from Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO–red dots) to the scleral flange opening (SFO-yellow dots). OCT landmarks are shown relative to the Foveal-to-BMO centroid (FoBMO) axis and 12 FoBMO 30° sectors (sectoral acronyms defined below). (B) Here the EOCBT region (BMO peripheral to the ASCO) is shown in translucent green), and the adjacent crescent of ESF is shown in translucent magenta (also on the left of Panel D). (C) OCT-radial B-scan from the location depicted by the green line in Panel B. (D) The scleral flange histologically refers to the region of the pNC-sclera that is internal to the insertion of the dural sheath.23–26 Because, the dural sheath is not consistently visualized in OCT B-scans, the outer boundary of the scleral flange can not (yet) be consistently determined by OCT. We hypothesize that EOCBT and ESF regions are a manifestation of neural canal remodeling that is required when BMO enlarges and/or shifts temporally relative to the ASCO and SFO (when present).

  "figure_5": "(A-C, left). See Figures 1 and 3 for the clinical photos and ONH location of the B-scans for this Hi-Myo-GL-29 eye. (B) Morphologic variation in the anterior, internal and posterior scleral flange surfaces are illustrated. Unlike the anterior and internal surfaces which can be histologically defined, the posterior scleral flange “surface” and “peripheral” extent of the scleral flange cannot be histologically determined and should be considered a biological continuum. We define the neural canal to extend from BMO through the posterior scleral canal opening (PSCO) with a variable transition into the orbital pial sheath. (C) In this study, measurement of the exposed neural canal (ENC), externally oblique choroidal border tissue (EOCBT), and the exposed scleral flange (ESF) regions was performed after projection of all segmented BMO, ASCO and SFO points to the BMO reference plane (see methods). (D) Projecting Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO), anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) and scleral flange opening (SFO) points to the BMO reference plane allows EOCBT and ESF measurements to be made relative to the Foveal to BMO centroid (FoBMO) axis and FoBMO 30° sectors. (E) BMO, ASCO and SFO B splines plotted within the BMO reference plane relative to the FoBMO axis and FoBMO 30° sectors (white lines) then ESF, EOCBT and ENC (ENC = ESF + EOCBT) measurements can be made within four equidistance re-sampling lines within each 30° sector and averaged. Data from Sectors with less than 2 measurements were not included. See Figure 3 for the 30° sectoral acronym names shown in Panel E.",
  "figure_6": "(A) Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO), (B) the anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO), (C) the scleral flange opening (SFO) (see Methods) and (D) Neural Canal Minimum Cross-Sectional area (NCMCA) which is an estimate of the smallest dimension of the pre-scleral neural canal through which the retinal ganglion cell axons pass (see Methods and Supplemental Figure 2). For the four openings shown, their size and shape (ovality index) was assessed using a best-fit ellipse within their best fit reference plane. The 48 SFO points (24 radials, 2 points per radial) consist of the SFO points where present, and the ASCO points, at the radial locations where an SFO point is not present. The NCMCA is calculated within the prescleral neural canal axis perpendicular plane. The sizes and shapes of each opening cannot be accurately compared in this Figure. They must be seen within a common viewing plane and positioned relative to a common centroid and common long axis to be directly comparable (see Methods).",
  "figure_7": "The BMO/ASCO Centroid Vector (A) and BMO/SFO centroid vector (B) are shown above. The BMO/ASCO (C) and BMO/SFO (D) offset vectors after each has been transposed to the BMO centroid for offset direction and magnitude measurement (see Methods). Note that BMO/SFO offset is greater than BMO/ASCO offset in this eye. Because we hypothesize that the SFO opening is the “original” (i.e., “post-embryonic” or “pre-myopic neural canal remodeling”) ASCO, we believe that BMO/SFO offset magnitude more accurately reflects the magnitude of myopic neural canal remodeling in a given eye, especially those eyes with a Hi-ESF region (see Discussion).",

For this analysis, eye-specific sectoral values for sectors in which there was no ENC, no EOCBT, no ESF region, no pNC-RNFLT or no pNC-CT were treated as zero (0). All 30° sectoral data are in right eye orientation (upper left panel, see Figure 3 legend for the sectoral acronym definitions).

  "figure_10": "(Left Panel) The existing exposed neural canal (ENC) region from the 48 year old Hi-Myo-GL-29 example eye from Figure 4 is used to create a “Proposed Longitudinal Change” scenario (Left Middle Panels - top-to-bottom) in which CBT “externalization” and “insertion migration” away from the post-embryonic ASCO creates an ESF region and a geometrically identifiable SFO that is separate from the ASCO. However, an “Alternative Longitudinal Change” scenario (Right Middle Panels – top-to-bottom) can be imagined, in which the CBT is externalized and elongates progressively without losing its insertion into the original “synonymous” ASCO/SFO point. (Right Panel) Had CBT elongation alone occurred, the expected composition of the ENC region would consist entirely of an EOCBT region only – without creating an ESF region.

We predict that NCSFB will be significantly increased as will “running length” measures of the ESF region in the Hi-Myo-GL versus the Hi-Myo-Healthy eyes."
