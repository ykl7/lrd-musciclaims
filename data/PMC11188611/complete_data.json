      "caption": "Factors from BCSCs and cellular components in tumor microenvironment (TME) regulate breast cancer stemness and metastasis\nImpact of different cellular components on breast cancer metastasis. Breast cancer cells survive immune-killing by regulating T cells, B cells, NK cells, and MDSCs, which, in turn, promote breast cancer cell metastasis. Conversely, breast cancer cells induce the formation of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts. These induced cell components assist breast cancer metastasis by increasing breast cancer cell invasiveness or by forming a metastatic niche. Cell components in the TME also interact with each other. CD4+ T cells can be regulated by B cells and macrophages can be converted into M2-like macrophages by T cells or adipocytes, increasing the risk of breast cancer metastasis. Finally, fibroblasts, monocytes, and adipocytes can promote angiogenesis and facilitate breast cancer cell metastasis. βGBP, β-galactoside-binding protein; MICA, MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence a; MICB, MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B; TIGIT, T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains; KLRG1, killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1; HSPA4, heat shock protein family a member 4; FAs, fatty acids; FFAs, free fatty acids; EVs, extracellular vesicles; BFT, B. fragilis toxin.",
