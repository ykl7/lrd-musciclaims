  "figure_1": "Ice crystal formation and artifactual retinal detachment in frozen pig eye during sectioning. (a) Image of a pig eye frozen in optimal cutting temperature embedding media and mounted in a cryostat for sectioning. (b) Ice crystals are observed in the vitreous immediately after 25 μm section was cut and mounted on a glass slide (arrows). (c) A few seconds later, the same slide shows artifactual detachment of the retina (arrows).",
  "figure_2": "Fixation of large eyes for frozen sections. Enucleated eyes are fixed in either 10% formalin or 4% PFA at room temperature (RT) for 4–6 h, followed by removal of muscle, adipose, and connective tissue resulting in clean sclera (a). Eyes are incubated in fixative for an additional 12 h at room temperature, placed on a flat surface and a trephine is used to remove the cornea (b). The eye is immersed in fixative, incubated at 4°C overnight, and then the lens, iris and zonules are removed (c). Under a dissecting microscope, fixative is injected into the vitreous through a 23‐gauge needle to disrupt the vitreous, and the fixative‐filled eyecup is incubated at 4°C for 12 h (d).",
  "figure_3": "Cryopreservation, vitreous replacement, and embedding of a large eye for frozen sections. (a) After fixation, the two‐step process of cryopreservation begins by visualizing the eyecup under a dissecting microscope and injecting a solution of 15% sucrose/phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) into the vitreous to disrupt it. The eyecup filled with 15% sucrose/PBS is returned to 4°C for 12 h. The second step of cryopreservation is initiated by injecting 30% sucrose/PBS into the vitreous and combining fluid‐based dissection with mechanical dissection with scissors to remove all of the vitreous followed by incubation of the eyecup filled with 30% sucrose/PBS at 4°C for 12 h. (b) A 10 mL syringe is filled with OCT compound, the 30% sucrose/PBS is removed from the eyecup, and OCT is slowly injected completely filling the eyecup. (c) The eyecup is placed in a mold made of aluminum foil, additional OCT is injected to submerge the eyecup, and it is frozen at −80°C overnight.",
  "figure_4": "Cryosections of ex vivo pig eye after suprachoroidal injection of India ink. Enucleated pig eyes were given a suprachoroidal injection of 200 μL of India ink and then fixed, cryopreserved and embedded in OCT as described in text. (a) An image of the frozen tissue block in the cryostat shows the structure of the eye well‐maintained with homogeneous embedding medium without ice crystals in the vitreous cavity and India ink visualized in the suprachoroidal space (SCS) around the circumference of the eye. (b) Light micrograph of a 25 μm frozen section shows good maintenance of the shape and structure of the eye with India ink marking the expanded suprachoroidal space. High magnification views from different parts of the eye shows intact unstained retina despite 48 h of postmortem time prior to fixation (c, d).",
  "figure_5": "Ocular sections of minipig and monkey eyes after suprachoroidal injection of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid, pCAG‐GFP‐Z1. Göttingen minipigs and a rhesus monkey were given a suprachoroidal injection of 50 μL of polymeric nanoparticles containing 0.33 μg/μL CAG‐GFP‐Z1 plasmid. After 2 weeks, the eyes were prepared for frozen sections as described in the text and 25 μm frozen sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy. (a) A low power view of a transverse ocular frozen section through the equator of the minipig eye shows the shape of the eye is well‐maintained and there is fluorescence around the entire circumference. High magnification of the fluorescence image alone (b) or merged with light microscopic image to show nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 (c), illustrate good retinal morphology with fluorescence in multiple layers of the retina (d–f). Some sections were immunohistochemically stained with anti‐GFP antibody and a representative section is shown confirming that the fluorescence is due to GFP expression (e). A transverse frozen section from the monkey eye illustrates GFP fluorescence in the sclera, RPE, and inner segments of photoreceptors (g). Cone matrix sheaths stained with rhodamine‐labeled peanut agglutinin surround GFP in cone inner segments and illustrate excellent cone morphology (h, i). GCL, ganglion cell layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; IS/OS, inner segment/outer segment; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium.",
  "figure_6": "Immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and histochemical staining with peanut agglutinin (PNA) in rabbit frozen ocular sections and human eyes. Ocular frozen sections from rabbit eyes processed as described in the text were immunostained for GFAP and histochemically stained with rhodamine‐labeled PNA. (a) Green channel shows GFAP‐stained glial cells in the inner retina. (b) Red channel shows PNA‐stained cone matrix sheaths surrounding cone photoreceptors. (c) Merging of the fluorescence images and a light micrograph of Hoechst‐stained nuclei illustrate excellent retinal morphology. A postmortem human eye was placed in fixative 48 h after death and processed as described in the text. Frozen sections were stained with rhodamine‐labeled PNA and counterstained with Hoechst. Low power (d) and high power (e) images show excellent preservation of retinal morphology with blue stained nuclei in the INL and ONL with red‐stained cone matrix sheath adjacent to the ONL.
