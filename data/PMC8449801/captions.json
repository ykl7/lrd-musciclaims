(d) SNP‐treatment interaction GWAS signals show opposite effects on BCFI in the anastrozole arm GWAS vs. the exemestane arm GWAS. Hazard ration from two GWASs. X axis: Hazard ration from the exemestane arm GWAS (BCFI_EXE_HR). Y axis: Hazard ration from the anastrozole arm GWAS (BCFI_ANA_HR). Significance indicated by size, and averaged log (p value) by color. (e) 261 SNP‐treatment interaction GWAS signals showed opposite effects on BCFI in the anastrozole arm GWAS (green) vs. the exemestane arm GWAS (blue), but not associated with BCFI in the combined cohort GWAS (red). Three sets of ordered HRs of 261 SNPs from three GWASs; the whole cohort (red), patients who received only anastrozole (green) and patients who received only exemestane (blue). (f) Venn diagram of the SNPs that were selected after performing clumping using three different criteria (see Methods). BCFI, Breast Cancer Free Interval; GWAS, genomewide association studies; HR, hazard ratio; MAF, Minor Allele Frequency; SNP, single‐nucleotide polymorphism.",

(f) ERα ChIP assay showing SNP dependent ERα binding to the ERE region that is 200 bp upstream from the rs1877193 SNP in LCLs with different genotypes treated with the indicated drugs: androstenedione (A), anastrozole (Ana), and exemestane (Exe) (n = 3, means ± SEM). **P < 0.01. Statistical test: two‐way ANOVA. (g) MCF‐7 and T47D cells were transfected with ESR1 siRNA. Forty‐eight hours later, mRNA was harvested for qRT‐PCR (n = 3, means ± SEM). **P < 0.01. (h–j) Reporter gene assays for the LY75 rs1877193 SNP. The rs1877193 SNP was included in the LY75 promotor sequence that was subcloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, Luc2. The plasmids contained either WT or variant sequences for the SNP and were transfected into h LCLs, i MCF‐7, and j T47D cells. Values shown for h–j are ratios of relative light units (RLUs) compared with the internal reference after vehicle (baseline), A, Ana, or Exe treatment (n = 3, means ± SEM). **P < 0.01, ns, not significant. Statistical test: two‐way ANOVA. ANOVA, analysis of variance; LCL, lymphoblastoid cell line; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; qRT‐PCR, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction; SNP, single‐nucleotide polymorphism.",
