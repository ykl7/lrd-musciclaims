  "figure_1": "A, PGRMC1 is overexpressed in human breast cancers of the basal subtype using PAM50. TMEM97 has the highest expression in luminal B tumors. B, PGRMC1 is overexpressed in hormone receptor–negative cancers. LDLR expression is highest in ER−/HER2+. TMEM97 has the highest expression in ER+/HER2+ tumors. C, PGRMC1 is overexpressed in smaller higher-grade tumors. LDLR and TMEM97 expression is highest in higher-grade tumors.",

Effect size estimates were aggregated across datasets by meta-analysis to determine the risk of relapse within 5 years from all cancers. A, Association of PGRMC1 with early breast cancer relapse. B, Association of PGRMC1 with early breast cancer relapse within the basal subtype. C, Association of PGRMC1 with early relapse adjusted for estimated proliferation. JRH, John Radcliffe Hospital.",

Effect size estimates were aggregated across datasets by meta-analysis to determine the risk of relapse within 5 years. A, TMEM97 is associated with early breast cancer relapse only in ER+ tumors. B, TMEM97 is associated with early breast cancer relapse only in ER+/HER2− tumors. C, Association of TMEM97 with early breast cancer relapse in ER+/HER2− tumors adjusted for proliferation.
