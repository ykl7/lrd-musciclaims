  "figure_3": "Odds ratios (ORs) and AUCs were generated using data from Malaysia Breast Cancer Genetics (MyBrCa) and Singapore Breast Cancer Cohort (SGBCC) studies, stratified by ethnicity. The squares represent the odds ratios (ORs), the horizontal lines represent the corresponding 95% confidence intervals and the diamond shapes represent the overall estimates. I-squared and p value (two-sided) for heterogeneity were obtained by fitting a random-effects model and using generalised Q-statistic estimator (the rma() command in R). The number of cases and controls for each ethnicity by breast cancer subtypes are tabulated in Table 4. The sample size, ORs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are also provided in the Source Data file.",
  "figure_4": "Results were generated using 5236/5516 Chinese cases/controls, 1084/1332 Malay cases/controls and 580/1018 Indian cases/controls from Malaysia Breast Cancer Genetics (MyBrCa) and Singapore Breast Cancer Cohort (SGBCC) studies, stratified by ethnicity. The squares represent the odds ratios (ORs) and the vertical lines represent the corresponding 95% confidence intervals, with middle quintile (40–60th) as the reference category. Solid lines represent the observed ORs and dashed lines represent the predicted ORs of PRS under a multiplicative polygenic model. Source data are provided in Supplementary Table 6."
