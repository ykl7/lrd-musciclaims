  "figure_1": "Molecular subclasses of diffuse glioma. IDH-wt tumors frequently exhibit receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) amplification and/or mutation and genomic dysregulation of PI3K/AKT, RB, and p53 pathways. IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas harbor either ATRX and TP53 mutation or 1p/19q codeletion (frequently in combination with CIC mutation) in a mutually exclusive manner. Histopathological trends regarding WHO grade and morphology are also shown. Abbreviations: Astro, astrocytic; Oligo, oligodendroglial."
