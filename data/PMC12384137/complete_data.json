The result is an inadequate immune response returning to the brain tumor via the systemic circulation and no effect on tumor viability/growth.

Higher levels of t-tau and p-tau correlate with poorer ADAS-cog performance, while higher levels of VEGF correlated with better ADAS-cog performance. Red dots represent AD subjects with higher (poorer) ADAS-cog scores, while green dots represent AD subjects with lower (better) ADAS-cog scores. (D,E) CSF t-tau and p-tau levels are negatively correlated with CSF levels of VEGF: TRFT re-balances these AD markers to eliminate their correlations with VEGF (arrows). TRFT re-balances VEGF levels in both CSF (F) and plasma (G). If baseline VEGF levels were low, TRFT increased those levels (red circles) and vice versa if VEGF levels were high (green circles). This re-balancing of VEGF by TRFT is also evident in bar graph format for plasma (H), wherein AD subjects were divided into two groups—low or high baseline (BL) plasma VEGF levels. The large difference in plasma VEGF between these two groups at BL was eliminated by 2 months of TRFT. (I) Baseline plasma Aβ 1-42 levels are directly correlated with plasma VEGF levels. (J) TRFT re-balances Aβ1-42 to eliminate this correlation with VEGF. Subjects with low baseline (BL) levels of VEGF are indicated by red circles, while those with high BL VEGF levels are indicated by green circles. It is evident that this re-balancing by TRFT primarily involved an increase in AD marker levels in subjects with low BL levels of VEGF. (K) As summarized in this graph, the re-balancing of AD markers in plasma by TRFT (as exemplified in (I,J)) primarily involves an increase in AD marker levels in subjects with low BL levels of VEGF to eliminate correlations.
