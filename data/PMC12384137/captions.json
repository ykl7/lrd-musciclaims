  "figure_3": "(A,B) TRFT reverses Alzheimer’s memory impairment in ADAS-cog13 and Rey AVLT 5 Trial Recall. Improvement after 60 days of TRFT was maintained for at least 2 weeks after TRFT; ES = effect size (as Cohen’s d) compared to baseline. An ES greater than 0.8 and 1.20 indicates clinically significant effects that are large and very large, respectively. (C) AD patients given TRFT over a period of 2½ years showed no “overall” cognitive decline in a Cognitive Composite score made up of ADAS-cog13, Rey AVLT, MMSE, Digits Forward, Digits Backward, and ADL measures. (D) The MMSE component of the Cognitive Composite score showed no significant decline through this extended 2½ year period. The red line and data points are from another study evaluating MMSE longitudinally in a group of “untreated” mild/moderate AD subjects. The dotted lines in (C,D) indicate the 8-month and 5-month periods of no treatment. (E) fMRI images comparing several hundred pixels within the cingulate cortex for pre- vs. post-TRFT (2 month) differences for each pixel with red, orange, and yellow pixels indicative of increased functional connectivity. Typically, only blue pixels (decreased functional connectivity) are present in AD subjects. (F) FDG-PET scans from an AD subject taken at baseline (L) and at 2 months into daily TRFT (R) showing cerebral metabolic rate for glucose. Note higher FDG-PET intensity after TRFT throughout the forebrain, as evidenced by more prevalent red/orange areas. Reproduced with permission from Arendash et al. [103,104].",
  "figure_4": "(A) Meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs), located within the brain’s meninges/dura, consist of both “Dorsal” and “Basal” lymphatic components (green vessels). Note the close parallel relationship of mLVs to venous sinuses (blue) within the brain. Selected cranial nerves are indicated with roman numerals. (B) Visualization of Dorsal and Basal meningeal lymphatic vessels in human brain using high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Gadobutrol contrast. CSF within mLVs is first transported to cervical lymph nodes and then into the venous circulation. Yellow circles in (A) depict the approximate head surface locations on the left side of the head for the four radiofrequency emitters of a MemorEM device (see Figure 2B,C).

  "figure_5": "(A) The immune system’s response to solid brain tumors (e.g., GB) is weak and ineffective due to minimal drainage of mLV fluid containing specific T cells/dendritic cells (red and blue spheres). This minimal lymphatic drainage via mLVs results in an insufficient presentation of these T cells/dendritic cells to deep cervical lymph nodes and an ensuing minimal immune accentuation of T cells/dendritic cell numbers leaving cervical lymph nodes. The result is an inadequate immune response returning to the brain tumor via the systemic circulation and no effect on tumor viability/growth. (B) As the primary modulator of mLV flow, VEGF in higher concentrations around mLVs will increase their flow, resulting in greater transport of specific T cells/dendritic cells to cervical lymph nodes and a consequent much more robust accentuation of their numbers leaving 570 the lymph nodes. Thus, a much stronger specific immune response is presented to the solid brain 571 tumor, which should result in tumor regression.",
  "figure_6": "The brain’s primary modulator of mLV flow of CSF out of the brain is the cytokine VEGF. Specifically, VEGF in and around brain mLVs induces their dilation and an increase in mLV numbers (lymphangiogenesis), as shown in the upper blue box. Through both of these processes, VEGF increases CSF flow via mLVs to cervical lymph nodes. As such, an increased number of tumor-specific T-cells and dendritic cells (and drainage of brain toxins) flow from the interstitial brain cancer into mLVs, then to deep cervical lymph nodes to induce a more robust immune response via blood back to the brain cancer. Shown in black circles within their respective tissue types are the brain’s three sources of VEGF: plasma in choroid plexus capillaries, tissue macrophages, and choroid plexus ependymal cells. T-cells (blue), dendritic cells (red), toxins (green), VEGF (yellow).",
  "figure_7": "(A,B) GB tumor-bearing mice received either VEGF or control injection via the cisterna magna. Around 2 months thereafter, imaging of the dura’s lymphatic vasculature revealed a substantial increase in mLV vasculature in the confluence of sinuses induced by VEGF infusion which was quantitatively seen as an increase in mLV area. (C,D) VEGF- or control-injected mice bearing GB tumors were treated with ɑPD1 antibody or control antibody. Although VEGF injection alone decreased tumor size and increased survival, the combination of VEGF plus ɑPD1 antibody induced complete regression of tumors and a long-term survival of around 80%. (E) VEGF intracisternal injection prior to GBM cell injection into mice resulted in long-term survival that was negated by depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells. Data in (B) are presented as the mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA). Figures and graphs adapted from Song et al. [105].",
  "figure_8": "(A) Striatal injection of GB cells over-expressing VEGF into mice resulted in an increase in dorsal mLV flow which was quantified by increased mLV coverage/area in both LYVE-1 and CCL21 staining of mLVs, as well as quantitative increases in mLV diameters. (B) Quantification of Dendritic cell (DC) trafficking to cervical lymph nodes revealed a significant increase in VEGF-overexpressing mice vs. controls. (C) Mice bearing GB tumors that overexpress VEGF-C showed longer survival times after being given anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 compared to GB mice (no VEGF overexpression) given anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 or over-expressing VEGF separately.

  "figure_9": "(A–C) ADAS-cog scores strongly correlate with CSF levels of t-tau, p-tau, and VEGF. Higher levels of t-tau and p-tau correlate with poorer ADAS-cog performance, while higher levels of VEGF correlated with better ADAS-cog performance. Red dots represent AD subjects with higher (poorer) ADAS-cog scores, while green dots represent AD subjects with lower (better) ADAS-cog scores. (D,E) CSF t-tau and p-tau levels are negatively correlated with CSF levels of VEGF: TRFT re-balances these AD markers to eliminate their correlations with VEGF (arrows). TRFT re-balances VEGF levels in both CSF (F) and plasma (G). If baseline VEGF levels were low, TRFT increased those levels (red circles) and vice versa if VEGF levels were high (green circles). This re-balancing of VEGF by TRFT is also evident in bar graph format for plasma (H), wherein AD subjects were divided into two groups—low or high baseline (BL) plasma VEGF levels. The large difference in plasma VEGF between these two groups at BL was eliminated by 2 months of TRFT. (I) Baseline plasma Aβ 1-42 levels are directly correlated with plasma VEGF levels. (J) TRFT re-balances Aβ1-42 to eliminate this correlation with VEGF. Subjects with low baseline (BL) levels of VEGF are indicated by red circles, while those with high BL VEGF levels are indicated by green circles. It is evident that this re-balancing by TRFT primarily involved an increase in AD marker levels in subjects with low BL levels of VEGF. (K) As summarized in this graph, the re-balancing of AD markers in plasma by TRFT (as exemplified in (I,J)) primarily involves an increase in AD marker levels in subjects with low BL levels of VEGF to eliminate correlations.
