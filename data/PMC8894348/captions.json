  "figure_1": "a In the conventional static sampling theory1,2, ommatidial facets set a compound eye’s photoreceptor spacing, limiting the finest image details the eye could resolve. However, inside an ommatidium, incoming light intensity changes make its R1-R7/8 photoreceptors rapidly recoil axially and swing laterally. These so-called ultrafast photoreceptor microsaccades enable Drosophila to see the world in a finer resolution than its eyes’ photoreceptor spacing, explained by the new active sampling theory4,5. Left: Drosophila eye computer graphics (CG) model highlights the axial microsaccade component; R1-R7/8s first recoil and then slide towards the ommatidium lens. Right: concurrently, the light-activated R1-R7/8 also swing sideways (laterally). A local (incident) light intensity change evokes microsaccades only in those ommatidia facing the stimulus. If this happens in the frontal left and right eye ommatidia with overlapping receptive fields, their microsaccades are synchronous yet have mirror-symmetric lateral components4,5. Meanwhile, elsewhere across the eyes, the photoreceptors stay still because the eye curvature and the ommatidial screening pigments block them from seeing the stimulus4,5. b The optical principle of the deep pseudopupil (DPP). DPP is a virtual image of several distal R1-R7/8 rhabdomere tips (highlighted in blue, yellow and green for three nearby ommatidia), which align with the angle the eye is observed at while being ~10×-magnified by the ommatidial lens system. These virtual rhabdomere images are optically brought together when the microscopes’ focal plane is ~200 µm under the eye surface (as shown in image 2). Because of the optical magnification, the rhabdomere tips, which appear deep inside the eye, are actually positioned at ~20 µm from the inner surface of the ommatidium lens.",
  "figure_2": "a Its integral parts are a sideways mounted stereomicroscope with a high-speed (100–1000 fps) digital camera and a goniometric rotation stage system. Drosophila eyes are imaged under the antidromic dual infrared illumination, invisible to the flies4,25. Photoreceptor microsaccades are activated by ultraviolet (UV or green) light stimulation, delivered through the ocular slot system. b The fly’s x/y-rotations are read using a 1024-step rotary encoder and an Arduino board. c The high-power LEDs and the camera were controlled over the BNC interface. d An infrared (IR) passing but UV blocking optical filter in the front of the camera decouples the UV-stimulus from the imaging pathway.

  "figure_3": "a Left: the Drosophila compound eye comprises ~750 ommatidia, each having a light focusing facet lens and eight photoreceptors; with their light-sensitive parts, the rhabdomeres (coloured), protruding centrally. Middle: Computer graphics (CG) models of the open wild-type rhabdomeres; here shown for their left eye’s southern hemisphere. Right: The CG-model simulated DPP image appears as a magnified “virtual” image of the open rhabdomere patterns. Here, DPP is shown at the focal plane of 200 µm into the eye for the right eye ventral section, corresponding to frame #2 in Fig. 1b and the bottom-left frame in Fig. 4b. b Left: in the spam, R1-R7/8 rhabdomeres reverted back into their ancestral fused rhabdom form. Middle: inside the ommatidia (in the retinal tissue), the fused rhabdom resembles a single rod. Right: their DPP appears as a tiny bright disc. Colouring indicates the contributing R1-R7/8 rhabdomeres’ relative locations in the virtual DPP rhabdom image. c, Left and Middle: In the honeybee apposition eye ommatidia, the photoreceptor rhabdomeres form a single rod-like waveguide, the rhabdom, centred ~100 µm behind the ommatidial lens. Right: In the DPP image, the honeybee fused rhabdom appears as a single disk, similar to spam.",

The green lines indicate the R1-R2-R3 rhabdomere axes, and the yellow lines the R3-R4-R5 axes. R1-R7/8 rhabdomeres rotate systematically with changing eye location, producing concentrically expanding diamonds-patterns5, highlighting the characteristic right-left eye and north-south (dorsal-ventral) hemisphere mirror-symmetricity. d The left and right eye spam DPPs appear circular-symmetric discs and are more oversaturated due to their eyes’ lighter pigmentation. e\nSpam eyes with their DPPs are viewed on the dorsal side, midline, and ventral side.",

First, the facet lenses appear (frames #3 and #4) before the DPP emerges as a small bright disk (frames #11 and #12). c High-speed imaging of photomechanical photoreceptor microsaccades. A characteristic slightly elongated DPP image of superimposed rhabdoms of neighbouring ommatidia. The DPP elongation is caused by the “ellipsoid” (non-spherical) honeybee eye shape. The scale bars give the actual rhabdom dimensions in ommatidia. The tested UV and green flashes evoked photomechanical photoreceptor microsaccades, seen as ultrafast lateral DPP “jump” and axial DPP darkening synchronised in time. The average DPP microsaccade to the green flash (green traces) was 1.54 times larger than to the UV flash (purple traces), consistent with the ommatidia having more 1.6 times more green photoreceptors (4) than UV (2.5) photoreceptors (inset). d Spontaneous slow eye-muscle-movement-induced (whole retina) DPP drifts were 10 to 100 times slower than light flash triggered photomechanical photoreceptor microsaccades. However, unlike in Drosophila5, the sluggish eye-muscle-activity shifted the Honeybee DPP positions over seconds and minutes more than the ultrafast (<200 ms) DPP microsaccade displacements superimposed on them.",
  "figure_8": "a\nDrosophila photomechanical photoreceptor microsaccades typically shift their rhabdomeres 1–1.5 µm laterally (max < 2 µm), equating to ~3–4.5° receptive field movements in the visual space. R1-R6 photoreceptors’ receptive field half-widths (Δρ, retinal pixels) are between 4.5-6°, over-completely tiling up the visual space4,5. The average interommatidial angle44 (φ) is 4.5–5°. Now consider this as image sampling by a digital camera. The spatial image information doubles when its sensor is moved, and two consecutive images are taken a 1/2-pixel apart and time-integrated for enhanced resolution. But if a pixel (receptive field) moves more, it eventually fuses with its neighbour (if that neighbour pixel was still – i.e. not detecting light changes). Because of this complete pixel fusion, acuity would decrease as the resulting neural image would contain fewer pixels. Therefore, by limiting micro-scanning to interommatidial angle, Drosophila can time-integrate a neural image, which greatly surpasses its compound eyes’ optical limits4,5. b Honeybee photoreceptor microsaccades shift their receptive field maximally <1°, approaching the eye’s average interommatidial angle1. Equally, such displacement is less than their average receptive field half-width (~1.8°) in the front of the eye34. As this active sampling strategy is broadly comparable to that of Drosophila, we predict that honeybee vision surpasses its compound eyes’ static pixelation limit, similar to what we have shown for Drosophila4,5.",
  "figure_9": "a A spherical compound eye illustrated with seven centred hexagonal rings. b The nth centred hexagonal number quantifies the number of ommatidia, N, within the nth ring. c Light rays emerging from the retina midpoints can be collected by the microscope only if their incident angle is smaller than the microscope’s half-collection angle, Θ. d Some light from the uncollected ommatidia may reach the microscope if it originates off-centre (blue). e light originating 1 μm off-centre is approximately 3° diverted from the optic axis. f The r parameters were estimated from the wild-type and spam DPPs, and one wild-type DPP rhabdomere. The scale bar corresponds to 50 μm in the DPP images and 5 μm physically in the retina. g The amount of DPP forming ommatidia (here c=0) rises sharply with the increasing microscope numerical aperture, NA.",

By 2D cross-correlation analysis, the DPP image locations were searched among the source images. b A cross-correlation result image R can be presented as a height-map, giving a better view of the cross-correlation landscape. c Two superimposed R height-maps reveal a small shift Δd in the location of the primary maxima; This is the DDP displacement. d The motion analysis results were transformed from the camera image coordinates to the fly coordinate system using the rotation stage values."
