      "caption": "a In the conventional static sampling theory1,2, ommatidial facets set a compound eye’s photoreceptor spacing, limiting the finest image details the eye could resolve. However, inside an ommatidium, incoming light intensity changes make its R1-R7/8 photoreceptors rapidly recoil axially and swing laterally. These so-called ultrafast photoreceptor microsaccades enable Drosophila to see the world in a finer resolution than its eyes’ photoreceptor spacing, explained by the new active sampling theory4,5. Left: Drosophila eye computer graphics (CG) model highlights the axial microsaccade component; R1-R7/8s first recoil and then slide towards the ommatidium lens. Right: concurrently, the light-activated R1-R7/8 also swing sideways (laterally). A local (incident) light intensity change evokes microsaccades only in those ommatidia facing the stimulus. If this happens in the frontal left and right eye ommatidia with overlapping receptive fields, their microsaccades are synchronous yet have mirror-symmetric lateral components4,5. Meanwhile, elsewhere across the eyes, the photoreceptors stay still because the eye curvature and the ommatidial screening pigments block them from seeing the stimulus4,5. b The optical principle of the deep pseudopupil (DPP). DPP is a virtual image of several distal R1-R7/8 rhabdomere tips (highlighted in blue, yellow and green for three nearby ommatidia), which align with the angle the eye is observed at while being ~10×-magnified by the ommatidial lens system. These virtual rhabdomere images are optically brought together when the microscopes’ focal plane is ~200 µm under the eye surface (as shown in image 2). Because of the optical magnification, the rhabdomere tips, which appear deep inside the eye, are actually positioned at ~20 µm from the inner surface of the ommatidium lens.",

      "caption": "a\nDrosophila photomechanical photoreceptor microsaccades typically shift their rhabdomeres 1–1.5 µm laterally (max < 2 µm), equating to ~3–4.5° receptive field movements in the visual space. R1-R6 photoreceptors’ receptive field half-widths (Δρ, retinal pixels) are between 4.5-6°, over-completely tiling up the visual space4,5. The average interommatidial angle44 (φ) is 4.5–5°. Now consider this as image sampling by a digital camera. The spatial image information doubles when its sensor is moved, and two consecutive images are taken a 1/2-pixel apart and time-integrated for enhanced resolution. But if a pixel (receptive field) moves more, it eventually fuses with its neighbour (if that neighbour pixel was still – i.e. not detecting light changes). Because of this complete pixel fusion, acuity would decrease as the resulting neural image would contain fewer pixels. Therefore, by limiting micro-scanning to interommatidial angle, Drosophila can time-integrate a neural image, which greatly surpasses its compound eyes’ optical limits4,5. b Honeybee photoreceptor microsaccades shift their receptive field maximally <1°, approaching the eye’s average interommatidial angle1. Equally, such displacement is less than their average receptive field half-width (~1.8°) in the front of the eye34. As this active sampling strategy is broadly comparable to that of Drosophila, we predict that honeybee vision surpasses its compound eyes’ static pixelation limit, similar to what we have shown for Drosophila4,5.",
