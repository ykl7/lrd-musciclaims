(A) Pseudotime of lens epithelial cells generated by Monocle2 package of R software, coloured by cell clusters and pseudotime. Each dot represents a single cell.

(A) Down‐regulated protein level of NOTCH2 in human highly myopic lens epithelium. (B) Down‐regulated protein level of NOTCH2 in mouse highly myopic lens epithelium. (C) Volcano plot displaying differentially expressed genes detected between cluster 2 and any other LEC cluster. Notch2 was significantly activated in cluster 2 compared with other LEC clusters (Log2 FC = 0.42, adjusted p value = 1.29 × 10−9). (D) Immunohistochemistry for NOTCH2 showing the distribution of NOTCH2‐expressing cells in the transitional zone (the area between two dotted lines) around the lens equator and a significant reduction in the number of NOTCH2‐expressing cells in highly myopic lens. (E) Western blotting analysis of downstream molecules in primary cultured human lens epithelial cells in response to NOTCH2 knockdown with siRNA. (F) Western blotting analysis of downstream molecules in primary cultured mouse lens epithelial cells in response to Notch2 knockdown with siRNA. Following NOTCH2 knockdown, its effector HES1 was significantly down‐regulated, while MAF, CDKN1C and fibre cell markers (CRYBB1 and CRYG) were significantly up‐regulated in both human and mouse primary lens epithelial cells.

  "figure_6": "Schematic illustration of NOTCH2 inhibition underlying the increased differentiation towards lens fibre cell in highly myopic lens epithelium. In highly myopic eyes, NOTCH2 signalling inhibition may relieve the transcriptional repression of HES1 on MAF and CDKN1C. MAF activation facilitates accumulation of β/γ crystallins which are specific structural proteins of lens fibre cells, while CDKN1C activation initiates differentiation. They together accelerate secondary lens fibre cell differentiation in highly myopic eyes. This figure was created by Figdraw."
