We propose that Ey (and other members of the PSED core unit of the RD network) function within the peripodial epithelium to activate Dpp signaling. In turn, as shown by many laboratories, Dpp signaling at the posterior margin (cuboidal cells) cooperates with other pathways such as Hh, Jak/STAT, Egfr and Notch to initiate the morphogenetic furrow. The RD network then, as currently envisioned, promotes the progression of the furrow by regulating Dpp signaling within the eye field itself. We further propose that in the absence of Ey, the other Pax6 protein, Toy, is unable to robustly activate the downstream PSED members and, as a result, the size of retina is reduced and variable. In animals that completely lack the compound eyes, the primary defect appears to be the loss of Dpp expression and a failure of the morphogenetic furrow to initiate from the posterior margin.",
