      "caption": "Light signals entering the retina are transmitted to various brain regions by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), exerting extensive effects on the organism. Upon penetrating the eye, light is projected onto the retina, where it is captured by ipRGCs. These ipRGCs are categorized into six distinct subtypes, each distinguishable by the size of their soma, the dendritic arborization within the retinal IPL, and their projection sites within the brain. Following the reception of light signals, ipRGCs project to downstream brain areas such as the SCN, VLPO and IGL, thereby broadly modulating the organism's physiological functions and pathological conditions. ipRGCs: intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells; IPL: inner plexiform layer; SCN: suprachiasmatic nucleus; VLPO: Ventrolateral Preoptic Nucleus; Suprachiasmatic Nucleus; IGL: Intergeniculate Leaflet; sOPN: olivary pretectal nucleus shell; cOPN: olivary pretectal nucleus core; PPN: posterior pretectal nucleus; PHb: perihabenular nucleus; vLGN: ventral lateral geniculate nucleus; VMH: ventromedial nucleus; pSON: perisupraoptic nucleus; dLGN: dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; SC: superior colliculus; AH: anterior hypothalamus; SPZ: subparaventricular zone; MA: medial amygdala nucleus; PAG: periaqueductal gray; BST: bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; LH: lateral hypothalamic area; LHb: lateral habenula; PLi: posterior limitans; SON: supraoptic nucleus; CEA: central amygdala.",
