  "figure_2": "Eribulin triggers apoptosis in leukemia cells. (A) Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in NB4, NB4-R2, MOLM-13, OCI-AML3, Jurkat, and Namalwa cells treated with graded concentrations of eribulin (0.12, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 nM) for 72 h using the annexin V/propidium iodide staining method. Representative dot plots are shown for each condition; the upper and lower right quadrants (Q2 + Q3) cumulatively contain the apoptotic population (annexin V+ cells). (B) Bar graphs represent the mean ± SD of at least four independent experiments quantifying apoptotic cell death. The p values and cell lines are indicated in the graphs; * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.0001; ANOVA test and Bonferroni post-test.",
  "figure_3": "Eribulin arrests the cell cycle at G2/M in leukemia cells. Cell cycle phases were determined by DNA content analysis by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry in NB4, NB4-R2, MOLM-13, OCI-AML3, Jurkat, and Namalwa cells treated with eribulin (0.25, 0.5, and 1 nM) or vehicle for 72 h. (A) A representative histogram for each condition is presented. (B) The vertical bar graph represents the mean ± SD of the cell percentages in subG1 from at least three independent experiments. (C) The horizontal bar graph represents the mean ± SD of cell distributions in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (excluding subG1) from at least three independent experiments. The p values and cell lines are indicated in the graphs; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test.",
  "figure_4": "Aberrant mitoses are observed upon eribulin exposure in acute leukemia cells. NB4, NB4-R2, MOLM-13, OCI-AML3, Jurkat, and Namalwa cells were treated with vehicle or eribulin for 72 h, fixed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The 400× and 1000× magnification images are displayed.",
  "figure_5": "Eribulin reduces the clonogenicity of leukemia cells. Colonies containing viable cells were detected by adding an MTT reagent after eight days of culturing the cells in the presence of vehicle or eribulin (0.12, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 nM). Colony images are shown for one experiment, and bar graphs show the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. *** p < 0.0001; ANOVA test and Bonferroni post-test.",
  "figure_6": "Eribulin induces molecular markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in acute leukemia cells. (A) Western blot analysis for levels of phospho(p)-STMN1S16, STMN1, γH2AX, and PARP1 (total and cleaved) in total cell extracts of vehicle- and eribulin-treated acute leukemia cells (0.25, 0.5, and 1 nM) for 48 h; Membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed with the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate System and images were acquired with a Gel Doc XR+. (B) Bar graphs represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments quantifying the indicated protein band intensities. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test.",
  "figure_7": "Resistance to eribulin is associated with the high expression/activation of MDR1, NFκB, and AKT in blood cancer cells. The heatmaps illustrate the expression of genes (A) or proteins (B) associated with resistance to eribulin in a panel of hematologic neoplasm cell lines. Gene data are represented as relative expression corrected by HPRT1/ACTB expression. Downregulated and upregulated genes are given by blue and red, respectively. Protein expression data are represented as relative levels corrected by the expression of GAPDH. Downregulated and upregulated proteins are indicated by yellow and purple, respectively. (C) Representative Western blot analysis for phospho(p)-AKTS473, AKT, (p)-NFκB p65S536, and NFκB p65 in total cell extracts from myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms cell lines. (D) Correlation graphs between expression of ABCB1, ABCC1, TUBB3, STMN1, p-AKT, AKT, p-NFκB, or NFκB and IC50 values for eribulin in blood cancer cells. (E) Using molecular markers that significantly correlate with IC50 to eribulin in hematologic neoplasms, a resistance eribulin-related targets (RERT) score was created, in which each cell line receives one point for each gene/protein upregulated (the median was used as the cutoff; the maximum number of points = 5). The radar graph shows the distribution of points among the analyzed cell lines. We note that the score precisely correlated with the drug’s sensitivity in the cellular models evaluated.",

(A) Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using APC-annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Representative dot plots are counters for each condition; the upper and lower right quadrants cumulatively the apoptotic population (annexin V+ cells). (B) Bar graphs represent the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments quantifying apoptotic cell death in Kasumi-1 cells after exposure to the vehicle, eribulin (2.5 and 5 nM) and/or elacridar (1 and 2 µM) and/or PDTC (10 and 20 µM) for 72 h. The p values are indicated in the graphs; * p < 0.05 for eribulin-, elacridar-, and/or PDTC-treated cells vs. vehicle-treated cells, # p < 0.05 for eribulin-, elacridar-, or PDTC-treated cells versus combination treatment at the corresponding doses; ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test."
