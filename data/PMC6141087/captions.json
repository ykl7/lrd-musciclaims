  "figure_1": "A. Variant allele frequency (X axis) was plotted against variant coverage (log10 scale, Y axis) in patient n2. ASXL1 c.1934dupG was present at a VAF different than those found for well recognized SNPs (TP53 c215 C>G, EGFR c1562 G>A and ASXL1 c2444 T>C). B, C, D and E. VAF (Y axis) is plotted in two different time points (X axis) in four different patient samples.B. Patient n2 (male, 65 year old) samples are shown. First sample (MDS RAEB-2, 15% blasts in BM aspirate count) was obtained prior to therapy. A second 28-gene NGS analysis was done 20 months after alo-SCT (trilineage haematopoiesis, 1% blast count in BM aspirate). A dramatic reduction in VAF for all the mutations found at diagnosis (ASXL1 c.1934dupG, DNMT3A c.2408G>A, DNMT3A c.2026 C>T and IDH2 c515G>A) is evident after SCT. C. Patient n6 (female, 62 year old) was diagnosis as AML with MDS related changes (52% blasts in BM aspirate count)). The patient underwent haploidentical SCT. On day #76 after transplant the patient relapsed (29% blasts in BM aspirate count). As shown, both samples share the same mutational profile, characterized by ASXL1 c.1934dupG, DNMT3A c.1948del, DNMT3A c.1685G>A, EGFR c.2988C>A and IDH2 c.419G>A. D. Patient n30 (male, 64 year old) samples are shown. First and second samples were diagnosed as MPN (JAK2 negative post ET-myelofibrosis, fibrosis grade 3 and osteosclerosis, blast count in BM aspirate was 1% and 8%). The third sample was obtained 30 days after allogeneic SCT. Pathological diagnosis was hypocellular BM (5% blasts) with osteosclerosis. The fourth sample was obtained 7 months after SCT and the pathological diagnosis was cellular bone marrow with fibrosis grade 2. A decline in the donor chimerism both in the myeloid and T-lineage cell types was observed at that time point. As shown in the figure, a dramatic reduction of both ASXL1 c.1934dupG and TET2 c.2108T>A p.1703* is seen after allogeneic SCT, in correlation with BM cellularity. Both ASXL1, TET2 and a new clonal population characterized by TP53 c.818G>A p.R273H mutation arises after therapy. E. Patient n1 (male, 79 year old) samples are shown. First sample was diagnosed as MDS/MPN (7% blast count). After 16 cycles of Vidaza/Revlimid the patient showed persistent MDS/MPN with 17% blast count. As shown in the figure, there is a shift in the clonal composition of the disease with a decrease in the three IDH1 mutations first identified (IDH1 c603_606del p.S202fs*7, IDH1 c624T>G p.Y208* and IDH1 c611G>A p.G204D) after therapy, but the emergence of new clones characterized by FLT3 c.1471G>C p.V491L, NPM1 c393_395dupGGA p. E131dup, KRAS c35G>C p.G12A and NRAS c.37G>C p.G13R. Both ASXL1 c.1934dupG p.G646fs*11 and MLL/KMT2A c4737_4739dupTGA p.D1580dup remain relatively constant along time."
