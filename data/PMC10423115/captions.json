University hospital 1031 of 1045 survivors responding; external oncologist 228/231; internist/practitioner 186/203; no follow-up care 16/72 (the width of the boxes corresponds to the number of survivors responding)",
  "figure_3": "Quality of life in long-term blood cancer survivors by follow-up institution as assessed by the EORTC QLQ C-30 (global health status 1519 responding survivors; functioning 1521; symptoms 1520) and HADS questionnaires (depression 1459). The results of the HADS anxiety scale (not shown) were similar to those of the depression scale. University hospital 979–1023 survivors responding; external oncologist 219–231; internist/practitioner 192–197; no follow-up care 69–70.
