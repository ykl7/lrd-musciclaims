(A) In addition to metastasized tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of brain metastasis consists of unique cell type(s), including astrocytes/activated astrocytes, microglia cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and neurons. The neurological secretions from astrocytes/microglial cells support the growth of metastasized cancer cells in the brain microenvironment. There are multiple mechanisms for brain metastatic cancer cells to evade immune cells; it could be through upregulating the PD-L1/PD-1 axis in cancer/immune cells, overexpression of surface receptors such as CD44, or by secreting exosomes or other metabolites that enhance the recruitment of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) cells. (B) Various types of immunotherapies, including anti-PD-L1/anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4, are currently being evaluated for the treatment of brain metastasis. The ITs enhance the activity of T effector cells (CD8+) or induce tumor antigen presentation to cause immune activation, which promotes cancer cell death.",

      "caption": "Metabolic milieu of tumor microenvironment and its impact on the functioning of immunotherapies or T cells. (A) Metabolic struggle and/or metabolic reprogramming transpire between various tumor-infiltrating immune cells and tumor cells. Both T cells and tumor cells preferentially utilize glucose to meet their energy demands. Due to high proliferation potential and high energy needs, tumor cells metabolize most of the glucose through aerobic glycolysis and produce high levels of lactic acid (lactate) in the TME, thereby, decreasing glucose availability for immune cells. The lactate-enriched and glucose-deprived TME impairs T cell functioning, recruits more (regulatory T cells) Tregs, and polarizes microglial cells towards a pro-tumorigenic phenotype and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). There is further competition for amino acids, including glutamine/glutamate and tryptophan between T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor cells. The availability of these amino acids in the TME that modulate T cell-mediated immune response, such as kynurenine (a product of tryptophan catabolism) produced by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) present in tumor cells, MDSCs, and TAMs blocks activation of T cells and promotes the recruitment and production of immunosuppressive Treg cells. The brain microenvironment has high glutamine and tryptophan; therefore, tumor cells easily adapt to the brain microenvironment utilizes these amino acids for their growth and development. Lactate production in the TME also increases the expression of PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells and suppresses the activity of immune cells. (B) The immunotherapeutic response of ITs could be enhanced by targeting the various metabolic regulators of tumor cells and immune cells. The utilization of inhibitors that specifically target glucose transporters (GLUT1), lactate production, IDO1 activity, and glutamine utilization in tumor cells could be a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacies of ITs in brain metastasis.",
