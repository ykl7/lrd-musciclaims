(B) Figurative description of membrane receptor to protein transcription pathways in melanomas. Expression of MITF; master transcriptional regulator in melanocyte development gets dysregulated by mutational functional loss in three different sites (a- MCIR receptor (red cross, b- BRAF, NRAS or NF1(black lines) and c- GNAQ/11(block dot lines) that mediate the mechanisms to turn them in melanomas.",
  "figure_3": "(A) Hedgehog signalling mechanisms in onset of basal cell carcinoma. a) In the absence of SHH ligand, HH signalling is inactive and receptor patched 1 inhibit SMO action that allow SUFO to hold GLI1 in cytoplasm and prevents its signalling for the transcription GLI target proteins. b) Binding of SHH ligand activates the SMO that activates the SMO and allows SUFO to release the GLi1 for its action in nucleus. c) Any functional mutation in pathed1 (red cross) or activating mutation in (green cross) initiate HH pathway in the absence of ligand that leads to tumor formation. (B) Key signalling pathways involved in squamous cell carcinogenesis followed by UVB exposure-mutations. Block arrows are indication of activation of protein while red T-bars shows inhibitory relationship.",

(A) Schematic presentation of the preparation of PLLA MNs and GNR-PEG@MNs, (B) Working protocol of the novel synergetic system to treat A431 tumors by the combination of NIR responsive GNR-PEG@MNs and MPEG-PDLLA-DTX micelles. (Step 1: Injected the DTX loaded micelles; Step 2: After the injection, pressed the GNR-PEG@MNs at the tumor sites and under 2 W/cm2 irradiation by 808 nm laser within 5 min).

(A, B and C) Schematic illustration of the microneedle patch modified with pH-responsive transition layers and gene (p53 DNA)-loaded layers, via layer-by-layer assembly.

(G) Image of isolated tumor after 21 days treatment of four groups. (H) Weight of isolated tumor after 21 days treatment of four groups (n = 4, * p ＜0.05), demonstrating that the p53 DNA loaded tr-MNP showed a great tumor suppression in comparison to the intravenous (IV) administration, because MNs can enhance drug utilization by avoiding gene loss in systemic circulation. Thus, both ntr-MNP and tr-MNP treated mice showed better tumor suppression in contrast to IV administration. Figure is reproduced from the reference [155] copyright © 2019 Elsevier.",

(A) Schematic illustration of the steps involved in the preparation of biomimetic NPs utilizing various polymers and cancer cell membrane derived from the oral tongue SCC. (B) Scheme presenting the mechanisms through which the designed delivery system worked to show the combined effects of gene (Nrf2-siRNA) delivery and amplification of PDT through the delivered gene. (C1) Confocal images of the cells after 48-hour treatments with free ICG, PPI, PPI-siRNA, and M@PPI-siRNA NPs combined with laser irradiation (+L). Mitochondria stained with MitoTracker green (M7514) and Cyt c stained with anti-Cyt c antibody emitted green and red fluorescence. (C2) Quantitative analysis of released Cyt c from mitochondria in the SCC-25 cells following the treatment with NPs and laser irradiation. Red fluorescence in the merged confocal images indicated Cyt c released from mitochondria into cytoplasm. Relative released Cyt c is defined as the fluorescence intensity ratio of release Cyt c in the treated cells to that in the control cells without laser irradiation. Scale bars present 20 μm.

(D) PTT and PDT efficacies of M@PPI-siRNA NPs in SCC-25 tumor-bearing mice: (D1) IR thermal images of the mice and (D2) temperature changes inside the tumors during 10 min-laser irradiations at 8 h after IV administration of normal saline (the control), free ICG, PPI, PPI-siRNA, and M@PPI-siRNA NPs. Upon laser irradiation, M@PPI-siRNA NPs showed an improved heating efficiency as compared to other treatments, increasing the temperature up to 56.5 °C, that is sufficient for tumor ablation. (E) Tissue distributions and tumor accumulation of M@PPI-siRNA NPs in SCC-25 tumor bearing mice: (E1) Fluorescence images and (E2) mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of tumors and main organs collected from the mice at 24 h after various treatments. ** P < 0.01 compared to the control; # P < 0.05 for the comparison between two treatment groups.
