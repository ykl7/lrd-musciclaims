Notably, the white matter tracts appear brighter, while the tumor (indicated by an arrow) appears darker than the surrounding normal brain tissue. Key areas are labeled: # for hippocampus, + for corpus callosum, ** for mesencephalon, and * for cerebellum. B: A magnified view of the region from image A. The difference in the CARS signal intensity between the neoplastic tissue and the surrounding white matter clearly delineates the tumor border. C: A CARS image depicting a breast cancer metastasis (induced by MCF-7 cells) in a mouse brain. D: A CARS image showing a melanoma metastasis (induced by A375 cells) in the hippocampal region of a mouse brain. E–H: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of consecutive sections corresponding to the areas shown in Images A–D. The arrowheads in these images point to the nuclei rich layers in the gray matter of the hippocampus. This imaging series, adapted from [60], demonstrates the utility of CARS imaging in distinguishing tumor boundaries and contrasting tissue types. (I–J) CARS images of astrocytoma in a mouse model. (I) A low resolution, large field of view mosaic CARS image providing chemically selective anatomical information. This overview captures the broad layout of the tumor and surrounding tissue. (J) A higher resolution CARS image of the area enclosed by the rectangle in (I). This detailed 175 x 175 μm image, taken at 80X magnification, reveals microscopic infiltration at the tumor-normal tissue interface. The level of precision is comparable to that of conventional fixed tissue with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histology images. Adapted from [58].",
