(b) Relative levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG (No Cancer vs. Heme, p=0.001; Solid vs. Heme, p=0.007) and IgM (No Cancer vs. Heme, p=0.003; No Cancer vs. Solid, p=0.03); solid (n=14) and hematologic (n=7) cancer patients and non-cancer patients (n=108). (c) (Left) Global UMAP projection of lymphocyte populations for all 45 patients pooled. (Right) Hierarchical clustering of Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) using Pearson correlation, calculated pairwise for lymphocyte populations. (d) UMAP projection of concatenated lymphocyte populations for each EMD cluster. (Yellow: High Density; Black: Low Density) (e) Heatmap showing expression patterns of various markers, stratified by EMD cluster. Heat scale calculated as column z-score of MFI. (f) Mortality (p=0.02), disease severity, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody data, stratified by EMD cluster (Cluster 5 n=5; Cluster 1,2,3,4 n=40). Mortality significance determined by Pearson Chi Square test. Severity assessed with NIH ordinal scale for COVID-19 clinical severity (1: Death; 8: Normal Activity)15. (g) UMAP projections of concatenated lymphocyte populations for solid cancer, hematologic cancer, and non-cancer patients. (h) CD8, CD4 (No Cancer vs. Heme, p=0.003; Solid vs. Heme, p=0.01) and B cell (No Cancer vs. Heme, p=0.008; No Cancer vs. Solid, p=0.03; Solid vs. Heme, p=0.02) frequencies in healthy donors (n=33), non-cancer (n=108), solid cancer (n=7), and heme cancer (n=4). (i) UMAP projection of non-naive CD8 T cell clusters identified by FlowSOM. (j) (Top) UMAP projections of non-naïve CD8 T cells for non-cancer and cancer patients. (Bottom) UMAP projections indicating HLA-DR and CD38 protein expression on non-naive CD8 T cells for all patients pooled. (k) Frequency of activated FlowSOM clusters in HD (n=30), non-cancer (n=110), and cancer patients (n=8) (p=0.03). (l) Representative flow plots and frequency of HLA-DR and CD38 co-expression in HD (n=30), non-cancer (n=110), solid cancer (n=7), and hematologic cancer (n=3) patients (gated on non-naïve CD8) (No Cancer vs. Heme, p<0.0001; Solid vs. Heme, p=0.02). (All) Significance determined by two-sided Mann Whitney test: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001. Median and 95% CI shown.",
  "figure_2": "(a) Frequencies of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh), plasmablasts (No Cancer vs. Heme, p=0.0001; Solid vs. Heme, p=0.006), and CD138 expression on plasmablasts (HD n=33; non-cancer n=108; solid cancer n=7; heme cancer n=3). (b) UMAP projection of non-naïve CD8 T cells with indicated protein expression. (c) Heatmap showing expression patterns of various markers, stratified by FlowSOM clusters. Heat scale calculated as column z-score of MFI. (d) Frequencies of CD8 subsets: naive (CD45RA+CD27+CCR7+), central memory (CD45RACD27+CCR7+), transition memory (CD45RA-CD27+CCR7-) (p<0.0001), effector memory (CD45RA-CD27-CCR7-), and TEMRA (CD45RA+CD27-CCR7-) (p=0.002) (HD n=33; non-cancer n=108; cancer n=9). (e) (Left) HLA-DR and CD38 co-expression in concatenated activated clusters (3, 4, and 5) and associated UMAP localization. (Right) Frequency of clusters 3 (p=0.03) and 5 (HD n=30; non-cancer n=110; solid-cancer n=8).
