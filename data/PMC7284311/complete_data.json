      "caption": "Eye Movements in Freely Moving Mice, Head-Restrained Mice, and Humans\n(A) Tracking eye and head motion in a freely moving mouse. Videos of each eye are recorded using miniature cameras and infrared (IR) mirrors mounted on an implant with a custom holder. Each eye is illuminated by two IR light sources attached to the holder. The mirrors reflect only IR light and allow visible light to pass so that the animal’s vision is not obstructed. Head motion and orientation are measured using an inertial measurement unit (IMU).\n(B) Eye coordinate systems used in this study (top). A 10-s example segment showing horizontal and vertical position of both eyes and head speed (magnitude of angular head velocity) in an unrestrained, spontaneously behaving mouse (bottom).\n(C) Horizontal (left) and vertical (right) eye positions for the whole recording of the data in (B) (10 min). Interocular eye positions were negatively correlated (solid black line).\n(D) On average, interocular correlations were small and negative. Mean ± SEM.\n(E) Eye tracking in a head-restrained mouse on a running disk using the same technique as in (A).\n(F–H) The same as in (B)–(D) but for a head-restrained mouse. In contrast to the freely moving condition, eye movements mostly occurred in the horizontal direction and were tightly coupled between the eyes.\n(I) Tracking eye and head movement in freely moving humans, using goggles with integrated eye-tracking cameras and IR illumination.\n(J–L) The same as in (B)–(D) but for humans walking through the environment. Interocular correlations between the two eyes in humans show strong coupling between horizontal and vertical eye positions. Note that the lines in (J) for left and right eye positions are closely overlapping.\nTimescale in (F) and (J) is the same as (B). See also Video S1.",
