  "figure_1": "The hypoxia-inducible factor HIF promotes the transcription of angiogenesis-related factors. The VEGF/VEGFR signaling axis promotes angiogenesis via MAPK, PI3K, PLCγ, ERK1/2, and eNOS. The PDGF/PDGFR signaling axis promotes angiogenesis via MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and STAT. The EGF/EGFR signaling axis promotes angiogenesis via MAPK, PI3K, PLCγ, and STAT. Other signaling axes (PDGF/HGF/IGF) promote angiogenesis through MAPK, PI3K, STAT, and RAGE.",
  "figure_2": "A. Hypoxia inhibits the activity of FIH-1 and PHD, thereby promoting the expression of HIF-1. Subsequently, HIF-1 stimulates the expression of VEGF, which in turn facilitates angiogenesis. B.\nHIF-1 induces endothelial to mesenchymal transition by promoting the activity of the transcription factors Twist, Snail, and ZEB2, thereby stimulating angiogenesis. However, its specific mechanism is unclear. C. Hypoxia promotes HIF-2 expression through a lncRNA that also promotes angiogenesis.",
  "figure_3": "A. Cisplatin-induced HIF-1α facilitates the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum. The released calcium ions in turn promote the expression of glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1). GSTO1 induces the recruitment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) through the PYK2 → SRC → STAT3 signal transduction pathway. STAT3 activity promotes the BCSC phenotype by upregulating the expression of the pluripotency factor KLF4.\nB. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α directly promotes the cancer stem cell phenotype in liver cancer. However, whether HIF-1α directly promotes the breast cancer stem cell phenotype remains to be validated. C. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinase cascade enhances the translation of HIF-1α by phosphorylating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E). Furthermore, this cascade pathway facilitates the interaction between transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP and HIF-1α, thereby augmenting the binding capacity of HIF-1α to HRE.\nD. Loss of PTEN promotes activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby activating eIF-4E, which in turn promotes HIF-1α translation. E.\nHIF-1α forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus, and acts as a transcription factor binding specific HREs on DNA, thus promoting transcription of the downstream target gene VEGF.\nF.\nVEGF binding to VEGFR on the surfaces of T cells promotes TOX expression and leads to T cell exhaustion. G.\nVEGF binds VEGFR and promotes the expression of FASL ligands in epithelial cells, thereby facilitating T cell apoptosis. H.\nVEGF/VEGFR signaling promotes the transcription of miRNAs (miR-142-5p, miR-183-5p, and miR-222-3p) and facilitates their extracellular transport via exosomes, thereby promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages."
