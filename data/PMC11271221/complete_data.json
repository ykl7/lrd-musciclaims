The released calcium ions in turn promote the expression of glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1). GSTO1 induces the recruitment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) through the PYK2 → SRC → STAT3 signal transduction pathway. STAT3 activity promotes the BCSC phenotype by upregulating the expression of the pluripotency factor KLF4.\nB. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α directly promotes the cancer stem cell phenotype in liver cancer. However, whether HIF-1α directly promotes the breast cancer stem cell phenotype remains to be validated. C. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinase cascade enhances the translation of HIF-1α by phosphorylating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E). Furthermore, this cascade pathway facilitates the interaction between transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP and HIF-1α, thereby augmenting the binding capacity of HIF-1α to HRE.\nD. Loss of PTEN promotes activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby activating eIF-4E, which in turn promotes HIF-1α translation. E.\nHIF-1α forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus, and acts as a transcription factor binding specific HREs on DNA, thus promoting transcription of the downstream target gene VEGF.\nF.\nVEGF binding to VEGFR on the surfaces of T cells promotes TOX expression and leads to T cell exhaustion. G.\nVEGF binds VEGFR and promotes the expression of FASL ligands in epithelial cells, thereby facilitating T cell apoptosis.
