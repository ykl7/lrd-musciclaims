(G) Schematic diagram of the synthesis of UCNPs@G4/Ce6/CAT-CTPP NPs.First, UCNPs-OA were fabricated via a high temperature pyrolysis method. G4-OH dendrimer was prepared with propargylamine as the core by repeating Michael addition reaction and amination reaction four times. Then, UCNPs@G4-OH nanoparticles were synthesized by thiol-ene and azide-acetylene two-step click grafting reactions. Next, the mitochondria-targeted molecules CTPP were covalently conjugated to UCNPs@G4-OH by the esterification reaction, achieving a multifunctional UCNPs@G4-CTPP nanoplatform.
