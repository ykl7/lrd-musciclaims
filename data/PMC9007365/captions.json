The fundus photograph of this eye of a subject with ocular albinism shows hypopigmentation of the RPE and visualization of large choroidal vessels. Cb, right: The druse in this eye with intermediate age-related macular degeneration caused an inward displacement of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), interdigitation zone (IZ), ellipsoid zone (EZ), external limiting membrane (ELM), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) which was associated with an absence of hyporeflective zones in the HFL at this site.

Mean ± S.D. total thickness and thicknesses of individual retinal layers at the macular/foveal center. Eyes with foveal hypoplasia were classified into two groups: high-grade (H) foveal hypoplasia with thick inner retinal layers at the macular center (n = 16) and low-grade (L) foveal hypoplasia with thinner inner retinal layers at the macular center (n = 25). As comparison, the thickness of the foveal center of control eyes (Co) with a regular fovea is shown (n = 75). C.

The images in A show sections through the macula of eyes with large (above and middle) and small hyporeflective zones in the central Henle fiber layer (HFL; below). The images in C show sections through foveas with the thickest outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the center of the foveola (above) and in the peripheral foveola (below).

  "figure_6": "Proposed spatial arrangement of Müller cells (A‒C) and spatial relation between photoreceptor cell somata (purple circles) and bipolar cells (blue circles; D‒F) at the macular center of eyes with high-grade (A, D) and low-grade foveal hypoplasia (B, E), and control eyes (C, F). A‒C. Because Henle fibers are composed of photoreceptor cell axons which are surrounded by Müller cell processes, the spatial arrangement of Henle fibers indicates the position of the outer Müller cell processes in the Henle fiber layer (HFL). The orientation and horizontal extension of Henle fibers differ between the three eye populations. In eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia, short Henle fibers traverse more or less vertically the HFL. In eyes with low-grade foveal hypoplasia, longer Henle fibers traverse obliquely the HFL. In control eyes, long Henle fibers traverse rather horizontally the HFL. There is no oblique arrangement of the Müller cell processes in the inner layers of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia because there is no widening of the macular tissue by contraction of the astrocytic network around the macular center during development. D‒F. The different magnitudes of the developmental displacements of the inner retinal layers and photoreceptor cells result in the formation of longer Henle fibers in control eyes compared to eyes with foveal hypoplasia. The levels of external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and interdigitation zone (IZ) lines were measured at the middle of the lines.
