The images in b show SD-OCT scans of the central macula at higher magnification. Ac. OCTA images recorded at the superficial (above) and deep vascular plexus (middle), and at the level of the HFL (below). In Bc and Cc, the OCTA images were recorded at the level of the HFL. Note that the OCTA images recorded at the level of the HFL show shadows of overlying vessels. Bd. The fundus photograph of this eye of a subject with ocular albinism shows hypopigmentation of the RPE and visualization of large choroidal vessels. Cb, right: The druse in this eye with intermediate age-related macular degeneration caused an inward displacement of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), interdigitation zone (IZ), ellipsoid zone (EZ), external limiting membrane (ELM), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) which was associated with an absence of hyporeflective zones in the HFL at this site. Yellow arrowheads indicate adhesions of the partially detached posterior hyaloid at the macular tissue. Red arrowheads indicate concentric rings of different reflectivity around the macular center.

A‒C. Because Henle fibers are composed of photoreceptor cell axons which are surrounded by Müller cell processes, the spatial arrangement of Henle fibers indicates the position of the outer Müller cell processes in the Henle fiber layer (HFL). The orientation and horizontal extension of Henle fibers differ between the three eye populations. In eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia, short Henle fibers traverse more or less vertically the HFL. In eyes with low-grade foveal hypoplasia, longer Henle fibers traverse obliquely the HFL. In control eyes, long Henle fibers traverse rather horizontally the HFL. There is no oblique arrangement of the Müller cell processes in the inner layers of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia because there is no widening of the macular tissue by contraction of the astrocytic network around the macular center during development. D‒F. The different magnitudes of the developmental displacements of the inner retinal layers and photoreceptor cells result in the formation of longer Henle fibers in control eyes compared to eyes with foveal hypoplasia.
