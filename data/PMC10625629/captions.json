(A) Bar plot showing mRNA expression levels of TGFB1 in normal tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. (B) Boxplot showing mRNA expression levels of TGFB1 in various tumor cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database. (C) Boxplot showing mRNA expression levels of TGFB1 across main blood cancer types in Hemap. The dotted red line indicates median value of TGFB1 expression. (D) Boxplot showing mRNA expression differences of TGFB1 between tumor and normal tissue samples, combining data from TCGA, TARGET, and GTEx databases. Blue, normal control samples; red, tumor samples. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; -Not significant.",

(A) Lollipop chart showing the difference of TGFB1 expression between normal and tumor samples across cancer types in Pan-Hem-Diff. Blue depicts down-regulation in tumor and yellow depicts up-regulation in tumor. Asterisks represents the statistical p value (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). (B) Genetic alteration frequencies of TGFB1 across four blood cancers. (C) Box plot showing methylation levels of TGFB1 across 9 blood cancer types and healthy controls (GSE28094).",

(A–C) Forest plot showing hazard ratios (HRs) and p-values of TGFB1 expression in each dataset among three blood cancers: AML (A), DLBCL (B), and MM (C). The hazard ratios and p-values were combined across datasets. The p-values were computed from Cox regression analysis in each dataset and combined using the weighted Z-method.",

(A) Bubble chart depicting the association between TGFB1 expression and 29 TME signature scores across main blood cancer types in Hemap. (B–E) Radar chart showing correlations of TGFB1 expression with immune, stromal, and cytolytic score across main cancer types in Hemap. Asterisks represents the statistical p value (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). (F) Pie charts showing correlations of TGFB1 expression with immune cell infiltration deconvoluted using CIBERSORT or MCP-counter algorithms in Hemap.

(A) Enrichment analysis for Hallmark gene sets between blood cancer samples (Hemap) with high and low TGFB1 expression (top 30% vs. bottom 30% of TGFB1 expression). NES depicts the normalized enrichment score using the GSEA algorithm. (B) Differential activity of Hallmark gene sets between AML single cell samples (GSE116256) with high and low TGFB1 expression (as stratified by the median expression value).",

(B) Bar plots showing percentages of responders (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) and non-responders (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]) to ICB among indicated ICB cohorts between patients with high and low TGFB1 expression (as stratified by the median expression value). (C) Violin plots comparing TGFB1 expression in responders (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) and non-responders (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]). (D) Kaplan–Meier curves depicting the OS and PFS of ICB-treated patients with high and low TGFB1 expression. The optimal cut-off of TGFB1 was determined by the Maxstat method.

(B) OS of patients from GSE10358 as stratified by the LI24 and LSC17 score. Patients with a low- and high-risk score were further dichotomized by TGFB1 expression status.
