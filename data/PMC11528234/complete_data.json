      "caption": "Future directions for radiomics in breast cancer\nWe propose the establishment of an all-in-one AI-aided radiology-clinic system, as well as optimizing validation methods and enhancing interpretability of radiomic models in breast cancer. For the all-in-one AI-aided radiology-clinic system, users input the unique identifier of a patient and select the needed function. For patients with screening demand, the DL section of the system utilizes well-established CAD systems to mark suspicious lesions for radiologists. Next, if the patient is confirmed malignant, the system automatically inputs the full-scale information, including clinicopathological indices, medical images, as well as multi-omics information. Then, the system automatically predicts the classification of lesion, molecular subtypes, lymph node status, as well as the prognosis and treatment response, and outputs all the results to the user in an integrated report. For the optimization of validation methods, we expect more studies to undergo external multicenter validation to assess the performance of the model, and we also recommend the clinical application of established systems to prospectively evaluate whether these systems will benefit clinical decisions. For enhancing interpretability, we anticipate greater and more transparent use of DL radiomics, and we look forward to broadening the understanding of imaging features through comprehensive radio-multi-omics analysis.
