(a) Spectral composition of the lighting environments in both SW and BEW groups measured at the corneal level of control eyes. (b) Relative spectral transmittance of the diffusers used for form-deprivation. (c) Spectral composition of the lighting environments in both SW and BEW groups measured with the diffuser at the corneal level of a FDEP eye.",
  "figure_2": "Experimental protocol. Thirty-six, 1-day old chicks were randomly assigned to two groups of 18 animals each and raised under SW or BEW light emitting diode (LED) lighting for 29 days. Animals were randomly monocularly fitted with a diffuser on D1. Diffusers were removed on D14 and FDEP eyes recovered until D29. Ophthalmic examinations were performed on D1, D7, D14, D22 and D28. On D29, animals were sacrificed and eyes were enucleated. The retinas and vitreous were harvested for metabolomic analysis. Ten eyes were dissected for histological evaluation of the retina, choroid and sclera. AS-OCT anterior segment optical coherence tomography, PS-OCT posterior segment optical coherence tomography.",
  "figure_6": "Venn diagram summarizing metabolomic changes in the vitreous of recovering FDEP eyes exposed to SW or BEW light in comparison with control eyes. Significant changes in metabolite levels in FDEP eyes compared to control eyes included increases in biogenic amines and amino acids under both lighting conditions, while glycerophospholipid levels were increased under BEW light and reduced under SW light. Ala alanine, Arg arginine, Asn asparagine, C0 carnitine, DOPA dihydroxyphenylalanine, Glu glutamate, His histidine, Iso isoleucine, Lys lysine, Met-SO methionine sulfoxide, Phe phenylalanine, Pro proline, SDMA symmetric dimethylarginine, Thr threonine, Total DMA total dimethylarginine, Trp tryptophan, Tyr tyrosine, Val valine.",
  "figure_7": "OPLS-DA on the metabolomic profiles of the vitreous and retina in recovering FDEP and control eyes. The metabolomic profiles were significantly different in the vitreous (a) and retina (b) of FDEP eyes of animals reared under SW or BEW light with Q2c scores of 0.56 and 0.65, respectively. Similarly, the metabolomic profiles were significantly different in the vitreous (c) and retina (d) of control eyes between animals reared under SW and BEW lights with Q2c scores of 0.60 and 0.84, respectively.",
  "figure_8": "Venn diagrams summarizing metabolomic changes in the vitreous and retina of recovering FDEP (a) and control (b) eyes in animals exposed to BEW light compared to SW light. Compared to eyes reared under SW light, the metabolomic profiles within the FDEP and control eyes reared under BEW, involved an increase in vitreal H1, a reduction in retinal acylcarnitines, as well as increases in glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in the vitreous and retina, respectively. Recovering FDEP eyes and control eyes exposed to BEW light also exhibited changes in biogenic amines (e.g., total and symmetric dimethylarginine (total DMA and SDMA), putrescine, spermidine, alpha aminodipic acid (alpha-AAA) and serotonin) and amino acids (e.g., alanine, valine, threonine, histidine and tyrosine) in the vitreous and retina.
