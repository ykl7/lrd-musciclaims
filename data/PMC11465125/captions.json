  "figure_1": "Examples of the five felid eye colors, with inter- and intraspecific variation\nEach row contains an example of each of the five eye colors and each column contains two representatives of the same species. Colors and species are as follows: (A) brown (Acinonyx jubatus), (B) green (Leopardus jacobita), (C) yellow (Panthera pardus), (D) gray (Leopardus geoffroyi), (E) blue (Felis bieti), (F) yellow (Acinonyx jubatus), (G) brown (Leopardus jacobita), (H) blue (Panthera pardus), (I) green (Leopardus geoffroyi), (J) gray (Felis bieti).

  "figure_2": "Phylogenetic tree of the Felidae (and outgroups), modified from Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds (2012), with iris color data\nDots next to tips represent the presence of each eye color (brown dot: brown eyes, green dot: green eyes, yellow dot: yellow eyes, gray dot: gray eyes, blue dot: blue eyes). A lack of a dot for a given color represents an absence of that color from the respective taxa. Graph created using plot.phylo() in ape.",
  "figure_4": "Reconstruction of the ancestral states of all five eye colors for the Felidae\nThe five-wedge pie charts indicate the presence (color) or absence (white) of the various iris colors. Colors were considered present if there was >50% support as determined by maximum likelihood methods (probabilities plotted in Figure S5). Exact branch lengths are not plotted and lineage names are given on the right.",
  "figure_5": "Quantitative reconstruction of the shades of brown and gray eye colors for ancestral felids\n(A and B) Reconstructions for the shades of brown (A) and gray (B) eyes. The squares at each node are the quantitative reconstructed shades. The proportion of a square that a shade takes up indicates how common that shade is in the data. Exact branch lengths are not plotted. The square highlighted in red is the ancestor of the Felidae.",
  "figure_6": "Correlations between the presence of different eye colors and various species traits\n(A and B) Correlations against the presence of each eye color (A) and against various physical, behavioral, and environmental factors (B). Larger circles correspond to stronger correlations and more opaque circles correspond to more significant correlations. Green circles have a positive correlation, red circles have a negative correlation, and gray circles do not meet the significance threshold (Bayes factor = 2)."
