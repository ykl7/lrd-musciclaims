  "figure_1": "Schematic representation of a multimodal data study. Multi-omics data containing biological information on gene mutations or copy number alterations, gene expression, protein abundance and DNA methylation can be integrated with data extracted from images such as digital pathology and radiological images combined with clinical data via data integration algorithms to fulfill three main tasks: patient stratification, prognosis and treatment response prediction, and biomarker discovery.",
  "figure_2": "A visual summary of the multimodal data integration methods mentioned in this survey. Methods are grouped based on their aim, with blue indicating machine learning methods and yellow indicating the deep learning methods; the pink dot next to the method name marks those that have been applied on a breast cancer dataset either by the original authors of the method or by follow-up work.\nBCC, Bayesian Consensus Clustering; FSMKL, Feature Selection Multiple Kernel Learning; iNMF, integrative non-negative matrix factorization; JIVE, Joint and Individual Variation Explained; jNMF, joint non-negative matrix factorization; mCCA, Multiple Canonical Correlation Analysis; SGCCA, Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis; SNF, Similarity Network Fusion.
