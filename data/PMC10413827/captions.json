  "figure_1": "Schematic representation\nof the long and tedious histopathology\nprocess. The patients need to undergo initial scanning to identify\nthe tumor. This is followed by a sample section which further undergoes\nmultiple processing steps taking longer time and needs to be confirmed\nby a neuropathologist which increases the chances of error. An error\nor partial removal of tumor leads to invasive surgery, again affecting\nthe health and quality of life of patient. (Created with Biorender.com.)",
