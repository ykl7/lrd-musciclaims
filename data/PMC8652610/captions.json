  "figure_1": "The Impact of age, sex and comorbidity on all‐cause fatalities split by haematological subgroup. All‐cause fatality is presented split by age (cut point 65), sex and presence or absence of a key comorbidity (chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, or vascular disease). Darker boxes signify higher fatality rates. The number represents all patients that fit into the two criteria (haematological subtype and characteristic). In all, 877 haematology cases were included. Overall, 44% died of all causes in the study period. Median age was 71, range 25–98. Age >65 versus aged <65 was significantly associated with increased all‐cause death [P < 0·001, odds ratio (OR) = 2·41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1·79–3·24]. Male sex was not significantly associated with all‐cause death (P = 0·832, OR = 0·97, 95% CI = 0·74–1·28). 431 out of 877 patients (49%) had one or more key comorbidities. Across all cases 52% of those with a key comorbidity died in the study period. Comorbidity status as a variable (0v1v2v3v4v5 or more comorbidities) was significantly associated with all‐cause death (P = 0·006, OR = 1·21, 95% CI = 1·06–1·4)."
