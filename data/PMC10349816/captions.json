  "figure_1": "A The expression of HSPB1 was elevated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues according to TCGA and GEO database. The RNA (B) and protein (C) expression of HSPB1 was upregulated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues based on Qilu cohort. Scale bar = 100 μm. The RNA (D) and protein (E) expression of HSPB1 was upregulated in most non-TNBC cells (MCF7, T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-453) and TNBC cells (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, HS578T) compared to that in normal cell (MCF-10A). F HSPB1 expression was detected by IHC. Scale bar = 100 μm. G Patients with breast cancer were divided into two subsets with low and high HSPB1 expression based on ROC analysis. The correlation between HSPB1 expression and overall survival or disease-free survival in breast cancer was calculated with the log-rank test. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).",
  "figure_2": "A HSPB1 overexpression efficiency was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot in breast cancer cells. MTT (B), colony formation (C), and EdU (D) assays were performed to evaluate the effect of HSPB1 overexpression on cell proliferative ability. Scale bar = 100 μm. E Wound healing assay was used to evaluate the effect of HSPB1 overexpression on the migration ability of breast cancer cells. Scale bar = 200 μm. F The migratory and invasive abilities of HSPB1 overexpressing breast cancer cells were assessed by transwell assay. Scale bar = 100 μm. G Western blot showed the effect of HSPB1 on the expression of EMT-related proteins. H Representative images of morphological changes of control and HSPB1 overexpressing breast cancer cells. Scale bar = 100 μm. I Morphological changes of control and HSPB1 overexpressing breast cancer cells assessed by phalloidin staining. Scale bar = 75 μm. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).",
  "figure_5": "A The protein levels in nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates were detected by western blot. Actin was used as an internal control for cytoplasmic lysates, and Lamin A/C was used as a loading control for nuclear lysates. B After 24 h of treatment with 1 μM doxorubicin, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with or without HSPB1 knockdown were stained with anti- NF-κB antibody to investigate subcellular localization and expression levels. Scale bar = 50 μm. C Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of Ikβ-α in cells treated with 1 μM doxorubicin for 24 h were evaluated for the presence of Ikβ-α, NF-κB, and HSPB1. D The interaction between HSPB1 and Ikβ-α or NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells after treatment with 1 μM doxorubicin was determined by Co-IP assay. E MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with MG132 or CQ, and western blot was used to detect the effect of HSPB1 on the expression of Ikβ-α. F MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with HSPB1-overexpressing vectors or control vectors. After treatment with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated time, cells were collected for WB analysis. ImageJ software was used to quantify band intensity. G HEK293T cells with or without HSPB1 knockdown were simultaneously transfected with HA-Ub expression plasmids. Then, cells were treated with or without 10 μM MG132 for 6 h and collected for immunoprecipitation with anti- Ikβ-α antibody and ubiquitination detection.",
  "figure_8": "A Control or HSPB1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were transplanted into the flanks of nude mice, followed by doxorubicin or PBS treatment (n = 5). Images of tumors harvested. Scar bar = 1 cm. B The tumor volumes were measured every five days. C Tumor weights were recorded after sacrifice of the mice. D The body weights of mice were measured every five days. E H&E staining showed the tissue morphology of transplanted tumors. Representative pictures of immunohistochemical staining of HSPB1, Ki67, CD31, Ikβα, NF-κB, IL-6, Survivin, and 4-HNE in the tumor tissues. Scale bar = 100 μm. F Pictures of lung metastatic nodules. G H&E staining showed the tissue morphology of lungs isolated from indicated mice. Scale bar = 100 μm. H The statistical graph of lung metastatic nodules.
