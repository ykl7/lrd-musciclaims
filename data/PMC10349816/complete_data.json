The RNA (B) and protein (C) expression of HSPB1 was upregulated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues based on Qilu cohort. Scale bar = 100 μm. The RNA (D) and protein (E) expression of HSPB1 was upregulated in most non-TNBC cells (MCF7, T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-453) and TNBC cells (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, HS578T) compared to that in normal cell (MCF-10A). F HSPB1 expression was detected by IHC. Scale bar = 100 μm. G Patients with breast cancer were divided into two subsets with low and high HSPB1 expression based on ROC analysis. The correlation between HSPB1 expression and overall survival or disease-free survival in breast cancer was calculated with the log-rank test. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).",
