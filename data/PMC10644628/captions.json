  "figure_1": "Box plots, stratified by language preference and geographic location, show the raw distribution of weekday (A) and weekend (B) sun exposure, sun protection behaviors (C), and outdoor intentional tanning (D) reported by participants over the past year. Bar plots, stratified by language preference and geographic location, show the proportion of participants reporting a sunburn (E), often or always wearing sunglasses (F), often or always wearing sunscreen (G), often or always wearing a hat (H), often or always seeking shade or using an umbrella (I), and often or always wearing a shirt with sleeves (J), over the past year. Purple diamonds represent population predicted marginal means or proportions. Asterisk(s) after the plot title provide P-values of the global significance from multivariate regression analyses testing differences in means/proportions across the three groups; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001. Brackets show statistically significant p-values testing pairwise differences adjusted using Tukey’s method for multiple hypotheses testing",
