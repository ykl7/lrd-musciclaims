Quantitative MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted or diffusion tensor imaging can be used to estimate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) map which report on different properties of water diffusion in the tissue. Within the segmented tumor regions, the ADC map can then be used to estimate tumor cell density using an inverse linear approximation.

Tumor cell diffusion is typically regarded as random, Brownian motion; however, D may vary spatially as a function of the tissue type (e.g., white matter or gray matter) or local mechanical properties. The advection term results in directed tumor cell movement and is often related to tissue mass effect or the deformation and displacement of surrounding tissue as a result of tumor growth. The third term on the right-hand side of the equation represents the net tumor cell proliferation or cell death (natural or in response to treatment) governed by a proliferation rate . The top two rows depict the tissue scale dynamics, while the bottom row shows an example of an individual cell’s movement (diffusion and advection) or proliferation from time point 1 (t1) to time point 2 (t2).",

The modeling framework (bottom panel) uses the initial volume fractions of enhancing and non-enhancing tumor (arrow a) and an initial guess of model parameters (arrow b) as inputs into the 3D two-species partial differential equation model of tumor growth and response. The model is then run forward in time to the next imaging visit (arrow c), and the error between the model and the observation is assessed (arrow d). If the error between the observation and the model estimated tumor volume fractions are minimized the calibration process ceases. Otherwise, the calibration process continues (arrow e) by changing the model parameters and running the model again.
