  "figure_1": "Proposed mechanisms between the skin and gut microbiota and skin cancer. A crosstalk between the disrupted skin barrier, UV exposure, and skin commensal microbiota can affect the composition of the skin microbiota. Altered skin microbiota along with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and microbial toxins can induce chronic inflammation of the skin and cellular damage, which may lead to the initiation and progression of skin cancer. The microbiota, DAMPs, PAMPs, microbial toxins, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and their corresponding cytokines and chemokines are major factors compromising the tumor microenvironment of skin cancers. They are involved in tumor progression by promoting immunosuppression, cellular proliferation, and inflammation in skin cancers. Additionally, microbial metabolites, cytokines, and chemokines from the gut can go through systemic circulation and impact the tumor microenvironment of the skin indirectly."
