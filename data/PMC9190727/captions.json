Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs); patient-derived organoids (PDO); genetically engineered brain organoids (GEBO); co-culturing GBM-derived GSCs with brain organoids (GLICO); cell lines xenografts (CLX); patient-derived xenografts (PDX); patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX).

  "figure_2": "A schematic overview of the main classes of in vitro and in vivo preclinical brain cancer models and their relative applications. (A) Brain cancer tissue surgically resected from patients is directly transplanted in the brain of immunocompromised mice, producing patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models (PDOX). (B) Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) in which the tumor formation is induced by gain or loss of function of oncogenes or oncosuppressors, respectively. They can be generated by breeding animals that carry germline mutations or injecting virus or plasmids, harboring the gene of interest. (C) Transgenic flies in which the tumor-like phenotype is determined by gain or loss of function of oncogenes or oncosuppressors, respectively, in a time- and tissue-specific manner. (D) Transgenic Zebrafish in which the tumor-like phenotype is determined by gain or loss of function of oncogenes or oncosuppressors, respectively, in a time- and tissue-specific manner. Xenotransplantation of human glioma cells in zebrafish. (E) Brain cancer tissue surgically resected from patients is directly cultured in 3D culture as patient-derived organoids (PDO). (F) Tumor organoids can be generated by gain or loss of function of oncogenes or oncosuppressors, respectively, in cerebral or cerebellar organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). (G) GLICO can be generated by co-culturing primary cancer cells with cerebral organoids. Based on published works, we summarized the possible usages of each class of the models in the following applications: genetic screens (i.e., testing the function of new genes in tumor formation, progression and aggressiveness); investigation of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, cell of origin and tumor microenvironment (TME); high-throughput screening (HTS) of new chemotherapeutic drugs and, finally, for testing new immunotherapy approaches."
