Von Mises stresses distribution is shown in (a, d), and displacements distribution (b, e) is plotted at 15 mmHg IOP. The difference between von mises stress in the ring-segmented model (c), and regional element-specific model (f) is shown in (g) as a map and in (h) as a polar plot. Finally, maximum logarithmic strains resulted in the stress-free analysis and their relevant displacements are presented in (i). The Z-axis is aligned with the axial direction of the eye in all subplots."
