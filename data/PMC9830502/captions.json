  "figure_2": "Interplays between tumor microenvironment (TME) and BCSCs. The TME is a complex network consisting of cellular and noncellular components. BCSCs interact with the TME through cytokines in a paracrine manner or through direct interactions. The cellular components in the TME secrete various cytokines/chemokines to support the self-renewal of BCSCs and help BCSCs escape immune attack. DCs: dendritic cells; TAMs: tumor-associated macrophages; MDSCs: myeloid-derived suppressor cells; CAFs: cancer-associated fibroblasts; MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases; GCSFs: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; SCF: stem cell factor; PHGDH: phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; MCT4: monocarboxylate transporter-4."
