We developed a gene therapeutic approach that combines one adenovirus that expresses Flt3L, which acts to increase the number of dendritic cells within the tumor microenvironment, with a second adenovirus, which expresses thymidine kinase, that together with the prodrug ganciclovir, kills brain tumor cells, releasing tumor antigens and inflammatory molecules from dying tumor cells. These tumor antigens are then taken up by the infiltrating dendritic cells, transported to the lymph nodes, where T cells are primed to induce a cytotoxic T cell response, which leads to tumor regression and immunological memory",
