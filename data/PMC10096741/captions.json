  "figure_2": "The distribution of Zn stable isotopes and their trafficking in and around a simplified breast cancer cell. Zinc in dark and light blue represents a relative enrichment in the heavy (66Zn) and light (64Zn) Zn isotope, respectively. ZIPs transport Zn into the cytoplasm both from outside the cell and from organelles. ZnTs transport Zn from the cytoplasm to both cell organelles and outside of the cell. Metallothionein and MMPs (both activated and latent) are strongly expressed compared to those in healthy breast tissue and benign tumors. Abbreviations: latent matrix metalloproteinase, MMPLat (light blue circles); activated matrix metalloproteinase, MMPAct (dark blue circles); metallothionein, Met (light blue heptagons).
