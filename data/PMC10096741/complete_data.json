Zinc in dark and light blue represents a relative enrichment in the heavy (66Zn) and light (64Zn) Zn isotope, respectively. ZIPs transport Zn into the cytoplasm both from outside the cell and from organelles. ZnTs transport Zn from the cytoplasm to both cell organelles and outside of the cell. Metallothionein and MMPs (both activated and latent) are strongly expressed compared to those in healthy breast tissue and benign tumors.
