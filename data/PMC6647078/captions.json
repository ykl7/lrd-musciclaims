The lesion had no hindered diffusivity on DWI with an ADCmean of 1.625 10−3 mm2/s and was mildly [18F]FDG avid on PET with an SUVmax of 3.7. Unenhanced T1-weighted imaging shows heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue (ACR C) of the healthy breast, with moderate BPE on DCE-MRI. ADCmean of the healthy contralateral breast parenchyma is 1.642 10−3 mm2/s. On [18F]FDG PET, BPU of normal breast parenchyma is relatively high with an SUVmax of 3.

  "figure_2": "A 45-year-old premenopausal woman with an invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast presenting as a mass lesion with irregular shape and margin and homogeneous contrast enhancement on DCE-MRI. The lesion displays hindered diffusivity on DWI with an ADCmean of 0.974 10−3 mm2/s and is highly [18F]FDG avid on PET with an SUVmax of 4.8. Unenhanced fat-saturated T1-weighted MR imaging shows a scattered amount of fibroglandular tissue (ACR B) in the healthy breast, while BPE on DCE-MRI is minimal. On DWI with ADC mapping, the ADC value of normal breast parenchyma is 1.693 10−3 mm2/s. On [18F]FDG-PET, BPU of healthy breast parenchyma is relatively low (SUVmax 1.9).
