Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) shows small, round, blue cells arranged in a compact and nodular fashion. Tumour cells were positive for synaptophysin on a background of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic processes. The tumour cells were negative for reticulin and showed only cytoplasmic staining for β-catenin, consistent with a non-SHH, non-WNT medulloblastoma. Ki-67 proliferative index was 30%.",

Second circle (grey shading) shows the somatic variants.
