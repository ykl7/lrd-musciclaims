(b) Spinal MRI revealed drop metastases in distal spinal cord. Inset: arrows indicate metastatic lesions. (c) Post-operative MRI showed residual disease within the left cerebello-pontine angle (dashed line) and hydrocephalus (H). (d) Histological staining of patient cerebellar tumour tissue. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) shows small, round, blue cells arranged in a compact and nodular fashion. Tumour cells were positive for synaptophysin on a background of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic processes. The tumour cells were negative for reticulin and showed only cytoplasmic staining for β-catenin, consistent with a non-SHH, non-WNT medulloblastoma. Ki-67 proliferative index was 30%.",

Histological assessment of (c) patient tumour tissue obtained at autopsy and (d) tumour tissue from TK-RIG915 PDX demonstrates that the PDX recapitulates the patient tumour histologically. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining depicts a highly cellular tumour and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Ki-67 confirms active proliferation. Positivity for OLIG2, nestin, vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by IHC support a glial phenotype.",

(a,b) Copy number variant plots for (a) the patient tumour and (b) the matched PDX TK-RIG915 tumour depicting loss of CDKN2A/B and hemizygous loss of chromosome 1p. Selected glioma-associated genes are indicated. (c,d) CIRCOS plots for (c) the patient tumour and (d) the PDX TK-RIG915 tumour show the range of molecular alterations observed in these tumours. Key to the CIRCOS plots: Outermost circle indicates the chromosomes, where darker shading represents large gaps in the human reference genome (e.g., centromeres). Second circle (grey shading) shows the somatic variants. These are divided into an outer ring of single nucleotide variants where each dot represents a single variant coloured as shown with allele frequencies (corrected for tumour purity and scaled from 0–100%) and an inner ring of short insertions and deletions (yellow and red, respectively). Third circle (red and green shading) shows all observed tumour purity-adjusted copy number changes (losses and gains indicated in red and green, respectively, scale ranges from 0 (complete loss to 6 (high level gains)). Fourth circle (orange and blue shading) represents the observed ‘minor allele copy numbers’ across the chromosome, ranging from 0 to 3. The expected normal minor allele copy number is 1. Values below 1 are shown as a loss (orange) and represents a loss of heterozygosity event, whilst values above 1 (blue) indicate amplification events of both alleles at the indicated locations. Innermost circle displays the observed structural variants within or between the chromosomes. Translocations are indicated in blue, deletions in red, insertions in yellow, tandem duplications in green and inversions in black.",
