  "figure_1": "(Left) Color photo of a non-human primate (NHP) control (N – nasal; T- temporal; S – superior; I – inferior). As is standard in clinical practice, N, T, S and I are assigned without anatomic justification based on the “acquired-image frame” of the photo (blue outline see Figure 4). The clinical terms “optic disc”, “papilla”, and “peripapillary” are based on the clinical disc margin which lacks a consistent histologic or OCT-detectable anatomic foundation (see Introduction). The clinical disc margin is therefore inconsistently assigned by clinicians (note open versus closed white dots) which undermines the anatomic foundation for concepts such as disc “size”, “shape”, “tilt”, “torsion” and the “gamma” region. (Center) Vitreal (lower) and retrobulbar (upper) views of an 8 mm trephined NHP ONH tissue specimen from the same eye. Note the dramatic increase in the size of the retrobulbar nerve and dural sheath insertions relative to the size of the clinical “disc”. We define the ONH anatomically and morphologically to include the tissues within the neural canal (Figure 2) and those immediately adjacent to it, namely, the peri-neural canal (pNC) retina, choroid, and sclera (Figures 2 and 3) as well as the immediate retrobulbar orbital optic nerve (Right). (Right) We suggest that the ONH tissues biomechanically and physiologically include the dural sheath, the pNC portion of the inferior oblique extraocular muscle (EOM) insertion, the posterior ciliary artery insertions (via the dural sheath – not shown), as well as the pNC scleral collagen ring, (not shown) and contained vascular circle of Zinn-Haller, (also not shown).",
  "figure_2": "(A) The clinical “optic disc” (or “papilla”) and “peripapillary” regions are defined relative to the clinical disc margin (Figure 1). (B) We propose that OCT evaluation of the ONH tissues should be organized relative to the OCT-detected neural canal and the Foveal-BMO axis (see Figures 3 and 4). We define the neural canal to be the connective tissue pathway through the choroid and sclera through which the RGC axon bundles achieve the retrolaminar orbital optic nerve. The “pre-scleral” neural canal extends from Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO) (the entrance to the neural canal) to the anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) and is defined by the choroidal border tissues of Elschnig (Figure 3). (C) OCT-radial B-scan from the location depicted by the green line in Panel B. (D) The scleral portion of the neural canal extends from the ASCO through the scleral flange opening (SFO – yellow dot on left) when present – (see Discussion section and Figure 15) and ends at the posterior scleral canal opening (not shown) which is inconsistently visualized by OCT. ONH neural canal tissues are contained within the neural canal and ONH pNC tissues are adjacent and peripheral to BMO and the neural canal wall.",
  "figure_3": "Descriptions of Panels A through H are the same for both the healthy control and highly myopic eyes. (A) A 24-radial B-scan optical coherence tomography (OCT) data set is shown (feint green lines) after acquisition relative to the fovea to BMO centroid (FoBMO) axis (red dotted line – see Figure 4). The single heavy green line depicts the location of the representative B-scan shown in (B) (superior-nasal (SN) left and inferior-temporal (IT), right). (C) The 3D point cloud of all segmented OCT landmark points which are segmented within the Panel B B-scan in (D). (E) The ASCO (blue dots) and pNC anterior scleral canal surface (yellow dots) point cloud which is shown within an individual B-scan in Panel (F). See the Methods section for a detailed description of this anatomy and its segmentation.",
  "figure_4": "The OCT FoBMO axis estimates the location of the histologic temporal raphe. FoBMO image acquisition is illustrated in Figure 14. FoBMO 30° ONH sectors from a representative study eye (FDA232) are shown. FoBMO 30° (clock-hour) or Garway-Heath regions, (not shown) can also be assigned post-acquisition to fundus photos by colocalizing them to the infrared (IR) fundus image acquired at the time of OCT A-scan acquisition. Conventional disc photos (Figure 1 left panel) and most OCT imaging are regionalized relative to the acquired image frame (AIF–blue image outline) vertical and horizontal axes (blue dotted lines) which have no anatomic foundation and are influenced by variable head position and cyclotorsion at the time of imaging. Using the FoBMO axis for orientation means FoBMO sectors are anatomically consistent relative to the estimated temporal raphe in a given study eye (and then among all study eyes) regardless of the amount of cyclotorsion present on the day of imaging. Also see Figures 11, 12 and 14. (S: superior; SN: superior-nasal; NS: nasal-superior; N: nasal; NI: nasal-inferior; IN: inferior-nasal; I: inferior; IT: inferior-temporal; TI: temporal-inferior; T: temporal; TS: temporal-superior; ST: superior-temporal",
  "figure_5": "The pNC anterior scleral surface was fitted using a trilinear model and pNC-SB-SS was calculated for three juxta-canalicular anterior scleral segments (0-300 microns), (300 to 700 microns) and (700 to 1000 microns) measured relative to the anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) within the ASCO reference plane after projection of these measurement points to the anterior scleral surface. Within each B-scan, the slope direction for each anterior scleral segment was determined by the position of its proximal measurement point relative to its distal measurement point (the position of the distal measurement point for each segment is depicted by the segment-specific, colored dotted lines). By convention, “outward” pNC-SB-SS (as shown above) was defined to be present when the proximal end of a segment was “below” its distal end and its sign was defined to be positive (+). “Inward” pNC-SB-SS (not shown) was defined to be present when the proximal end of a segment was “above” the distal end and its sign was defined to be negative (−). Note that since slope is unitless, pNC-SB-SS is a unitless parameter. pNC-SB data is multiplied by 100 to enhance visualization.",
  "figure_6": "A 1700 μm perineural canal scleral reference plane (pNC-Scleral1700) was defined by the plane that best fit the anterior scleral surface points at a distance 1700 μm away from the ASCO centroid (measured within the ASCO reference plane). ASCO depth was defined at each ASCO point as the minimum distance to pNC-Scleral1700 reference plane (negative (−) when above the plane and positive (+) when below). Global pNC-SB-ASCOD was defined to be the average of the 48 individual ASCO point depth values. Sectoral pNC-SB-ASCOD was calculated as the average depth value of the four ASCO points within each sector, (24 radial B-scans, each containing 2 ASCO points, yield 48 ASCO measurement points distributed over twelve 30° s sectors).",
  "figure_7": "Within the 3D point cloud of segmented points from each OCT ONH data set, (Figure 3), Bruch’s membrane and the anterior scleral surface points were interpolated using b-splines. pNC-CT was assessed in microns at six distances (vertical blue dotted lines) from the ASCO, measured within the ASCO reference plane, (horizontal blue dotted line). Each measurement distance was projected from the ASCO to the anterior sclera surface (yellow dots). At each anterior scleral measurement point pNC-CT was defined by the minimum distance to the posterior surface of Bruch’s membrane (red arrows) (pNC-CT 100, pNC-CT 300, pNC-CT 500, pNC-CT 700, pNC-CT 900, and pNC-CT 1100, respectively). To simplify data presentation, we concentrate on pNC-CT at the 300, 700 and 1100 μm measurement points (where they approximate the measurement of pNC-SS (see Figure 5). This strategy does not measure choroidal thickness between the pNC-CT 100 measurement point and BMO (transparent red). This region of the choroid can be the site of extensive neural canal remodeling and choroidal thinning and/or atrophy in myopic eyes.",
  "figure_8": "Data for three representative pNC-CT measurement locations are chosen to approximate the pNC-SB data locations above. pNC-SB data is multiplied by 100 to enhance visualization.",
  "figure_9": "All 30° sectoral data are in right eye, FoBMO orientation (upper left panel). pNC-SB-SS (0-300), (300-700), and (700–1000) radial measurement segments (top) and pNC-CT (300, 700 and 1100 μm measurement points) (bottom) are schematically presented in three concentric rings. For either the control or highly myopic eye data, (treated separately), for each parameter, at each radial measurement location, the three contiguous sectors with the highest mean value are denoted with bold purple font and the three with the lowest mean values are denoted with bold orange font. The three highest bowing or thickest choroidal sectors are significantly different from the lowest bowing or thinnest choroid sectors (p < 0.0002 for all comparisons, (GEEGLM model adjusting for age, axial length and ASCO area). pNC-SB (for all parameters) was greatest and pNC-CT was thinnest within the temporal and inferior temporal sectors of the control eyes and were thinnest within the temporal inferior, inferior temporal, inferior and inferior-nasal sectors of the highly myopic eyes. Within a second GEEGLM model, adjusted in the same manner, statistically significant (p < 0.05) highly myopic versus control eye differences (red asterisk) in the three contiguous minimum (orange) and maximum (purple) mean sectoral values achieved statistical significance for the majority of pNC-SB parameters and for the three thinnest pNC-CT sectors at the 1100 μm measurement point (inferior temporal sectors, bottom right panel). Taken together these data together suggest that while the sectoral locations of maximum pNC-SB and minimum pNC-CT do not perfectly overlap, highly myopic versus control eye differences in both phenomenon most commonly achieved significance within the inferior sectors.",
  "figure_11": "(A) BMO, ASCO and the OCT FoBMO axis are projected onto the fundus photo of each eye by colocalizing the photo to the infrared (IR) fundus image acquired at the time of OCT A-scan acquisition. FoBMO orientation of the data is achieved by rotating the photo (8° counter clock-wise above and 10° clockwise below) so that the FoBMO axis, rather than the Acquired Image Frame ((AIF) - Blue outline –Figure 4), establishes the Nasal-Temporal and Superior-Inferior axes (shown for the healthy control eye, above, red dotted lines). (B) pNC-SB-ASCOD data for each eye schematically presented in eye-specific, (left eye above and right eye, below) FoBMO orientation. (C) pNC-SB-SS data for the inner (0-300), middle (300-700) and outer (700-1000) measurement segments presented schematically in FoBMO orientation. (D) Continuously plotted pNC-SB-SS data in FoBMO orientation. (E) and (F) pNC-CT data presented schematically (E) and continuously (F) relative to the FoBMO axis. Note that while the sectoral differences in pNC-CT data are modest for the control eye (upper) and substantial for the highly myopic eye (lower), by inspection of the sectoral values, the inferior temporal regions demonstrate the greatest amount of pNC-SB and the thinnest pNC-CT for both the control and highly myopic eye.",
  "figure_12": "Data in this figure are representative, only, in that the MRW data (right), pNC-SB and pNC-CT data (center) and the pPole RGC and GCL data (left) have been compiled from different eyes. Structural abnormality data begin with representative ONH minimum rim width (MRW) data (far right) in which FoBMO 30°sectoral OCT rim anatomy is shown along with its MRW measurement (color coded to flag “borderline” (yellow < 5th percentile of the NDB) or red (< 1st percentile of the NDB) sectors. pNC-CT and pNC-SB-SS (middle) and (middle right) columns) are from the highly myopic study eye shown in Figures 3 and 11 and depict their relationship to the normative values for these parameters that we have reported in previous studies. As can be seen from these plots, pNC-SB-SS is increased beyond the non-highly myopic normative range within the inferior temporal sectors and pNC-CT is “Borderline” thinned within the same sectors. pPole RNFLT) (middle left), and pPole Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) (thickness) (far left) upper row data are continuous thickness or slope maps and bottom row data are continuous NDB percentile maps (red, yellow and green pixels as defined for MRW measurement arrows – far right). Though representative, these data serve illustrate, the OCT characterization of myopic structural alteration in a given eye.",

(ONH-RC - optic nerve head (ONH) 48 radial and circular B-scans (at three locations) acquired relative to the FoBMO axis, centered on the BMO centroid); (pPoleH - serial horizontal B-scans acquired parallel to the FoBMO axis); (pPoleV – serial vertical b-scans acquired perpendicular to the FoBMO axis.",
  "figure_15": "(A1 – C1, left) Representative OCT B-scans from representative non-highly myopic (A1 – top), (B1 – middle) and highly myopic (C1 - bottom) eyes. (A2 - C2) Because the internal boundaries of the depicted tissues are anatomically continuous, the internal boundaries shown are representative. The anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) is defined to be the projection of the anterior pNC scleral surface through the choroidal border tissues. The scleral flange is histologically defined to be the pNC sclera that is “internal” or “medial” to the dural sheath insertion. Current OCT parameterization of the pNC scleral flange (commonly referred to as the “gamma” region) employs a projection of the clinical disc margin rather than segmentation of the OCT-detected scleral flange opening (SFO, yellow circle) to define its inner-most margin. When there is a region of exposed scleral flange tissue internal to the ASCO, the SFO can be manually segmented either “geometrically” when identifiable (Panels B2 and C2) or “estimated” by visually projecting the anterior laminar surface through the neural canal wall (Panel A2). (A3 – C3) The slope of the anterior scleral flange surface (between the ASCO and SFO) can be calculated in a manner that is separate from, but complimentary to, the pNC-SB-SS parameter (Figure 5."
