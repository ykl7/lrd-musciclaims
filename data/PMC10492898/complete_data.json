      "caption": "(Left) Color photo of a non-human primate (NHP) control (N – nasal; T- temporal; S – superior; I – inferior). As is standard in clinical practice, N, T, S and I are assigned without anatomic justification based on the “acquired-image frame” of the photo (blue outline see Figure 4). The clinical terms “optic disc”, “papilla”, and “peripapillary” are based on the clinical disc margin which lacks a consistent histologic or OCT-detectable anatomic foundation (see Introduction). The clinical disc margin is therefore inconsistently assigned by clinicians (note open versus closed white dots) which undermines the anatomic foundation for concepts such as disc “size”, “shape”, “tilt”, “torsion” and the “gamma” region. (Center) Vitreal (lower) and retrobulbar (upper) views of an 8 mm trephined NHP ONH tissue specimen from the same eye. Note the dramatic increase in the size of the retrobulbar nerve and dural sheath insertions relative to the size of the clinical “disc”. We define the ONH anatomically and morphologically to include the tissues within the neural canal (Figure 2) and those immediately adjacent to it, namely, the peri-neural canal (pNC) retina, choroid, and sclera (Figures 2 and 3) as well as the immediate retrobulbar orbital optic nerve (Right). (Right) We suggest that the ONH tissues biomechanically and physiologically include the dural sheath, the pNC portion of the inferior oblique extraocular muscle (EOM) insertion, the posterior ciliary artery insertions (via the dural sheath – not shown), as well as the pNC scleral collagen ring, (not shown) and contained vascular circle of Zinn-Haller, (also not shown).",

(B) We propose that OCT evaluation of the ONH tissues should be organized relative to the OCT-detected neural canal and the Foveal-BMO axis (see Figures 3 and 4). We define the neural canal to be the connective tissue pathway through the choroid and sclera through which the RGC axon bundles achieve the retrolaminar orbital optic nerve. The “pre-scleral” neural canal extends from Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO) (the entrance to the neural canal) to the anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) and is defined by the choroidal border tissues of Elschnig (Figure 3). (C) OCT-radial B-scan from the location depicted by the green line in Panel B. (D) The scleral portion of the neural canal extends from the ASCO through the scleral flange opening (SFO – yellow dot on left) when present – (see Discussion section and Figure 15) and ends at the posterior scleral canal opening (not shown) which is inconsistently visualized by OCT. ONH neural canal tissues are contained within the neural canal and ONH pNC tissues are adjacent and peripheral to BMO and the neural canal wall.",

FoBMO 30° ONH sectors from a representative study eye (FDA232) are shown. FoBMO 30° (clock-hour) or Garway-Heath regions, (not shown) can also be assigned post-acquisition to fundus photos by colocalizing them to the infrared (IR) fundus image acquired at the time of OCT A-scan acquisition. Conventional disc photos (Figure 1 left panel) and most OCT imaging are regionalized relative to the acquired image frame (AIF–blue image outline) vertical and horizontal axes (blue dotted lines) which have no anatomic foundation and are influenced by variable head position and cyclotorsion at the time of imaging. Using the FoBMO axis for orientation means FoBMO sectors are anatomically consistent relative to the estimated temporal raphe in a given study eye (and then among all study eyes) regardless of the amount of cyclotorsion present on the day of imaging.

The three highest bowing or thickest choroidal sectors are significantly different from the lowest bowing or thinnest choroid sectors (p < 0.0002 for all comparisons, (GEEGLM model adjusting for age, axial length and ASCO area). pNC-SB (for all parameters) was greatest and pNC-CT was thinnest within the temporal and inferior temporal sectors of the control eyes and were thinnest within the temporal inferior, inferior temporal, inferior and inferior-nasal sectors of the highly myopic eyes. Within a second GEEGLM model, adjusted in the same manner, statistically significant (p < 0.05) highly myopic versus control eye differences (red asterisk) in the three contiguous minimum (orange) and maximum (purple) mean sectoral values achieved statistical significance for the majority of pNC-SB parameters and for the three thinnest pNC-CT sectors at the 1100 μm measurement point (inferior temporal sectors, bottom right panel). Taken together these data together suggest that while the sectoral locations of maximum pNC-SB and minimum pNC-CT do not perfectly overlap, highly myopic versus control eye differences in both phenomenon most commonly achieved significance within the inferior sectors.",

The scleral flange is histologically defined to be the pNC sclera that is “internal” or “medial” to the dural sheath insertion. Current OCT parameterization of the pNC scleral flange (commonly referred to as the “gamma” region) employs a projection of the clinical disc margin rather than segmentation of the OCT-detected scleral flange opening (SFO, yellow circle) to define its inner-most margin. When there is a region of exposed scleral flange tissue internal to the ASCO, the SFO can be manually segmented either “geometrically” when identifiable (Panels B2 and C2) or “estimated” by visually projecting the anterior laminar surface through the neural canal wall (Panel A2).
