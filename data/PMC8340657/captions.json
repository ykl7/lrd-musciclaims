Then one of the four face identities with overlaid white noise was randomly presented on the screen for 600 ms, during which participants could make free eye movements. After 600 ms, a luminance-matched Gaussian white noise mask was presented for 300 ms. Finally, the response screen was displayed, and participants clicked on the face they identified.",
