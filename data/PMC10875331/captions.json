  "figure_2": "Identification of CH genes associated with high risk of hematologic malignancy. (A) We evaluated 166 genes representing the union of 99 genes previously implicated in hematologic malignancy (CH-PD, M-CHIP, and L-CHIP)10,28 and 131 genes mutated at least 40 times in our dataset (observed in ≥∼1 per 1000 individuals). We built cause-specific Cox hazard models with Firth penalized likelihood including adjustments for gender, age, and solid cancer type for all genes and identified 9 with significantly increased hazard rate of hematologic malignancy based on false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1. (B) HR and 95% CI for high risk CH genes (red, top) and selected comparators that did not meet high risk criteria (blue, bottom). (C) MCAs were divided into an alarm group involving 5/7/17 and an “other” group that did not involve these chromosomes. HRs for MCAs were calculated using the same models described earlier.",
  "figure_3": "The association of CH with hematologic malignancy varies according to the disease subtype. (A) Fraction of patients with CH among those who developed each of the hematologic malignancy types listed. We combined MDS and AML into a single therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) group because therapy-related MDS behaves aggressively, and molecular characteristics better reflect pathogenesis and prognosis. Lymphoid malignancies are blue and myeloid are red. Total number of cases is presented at the top of each bar. (B) Fraction of patients who had preceding CH among those who developed chronic or acute hematologic malignancies. (C) Cumulative incidence of acute and chronic hematologic malignancies stratified based on the presence or absence of CH. All HRs and P values were calculated using a multivariate competing risk regression, adjusting for age, gender, and cancer type. CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasm; NOS, not otherwise specified. TP53/CK: TP53 mutation and/or complex karyotype.",
  "figure_4": "Relationship between nonsynonymous mutation enrichment and risk of hematologic malignancy. Gene-specific HRs for hematologic neoplasm (as calculated in Figure 2) are plotted as a function of context-corrected nonsynonymous mutation enrichment (dNdScv). High-risk CH genotypes identified in Figure 2 are labeled in red, whereas other selected genotypes are labeled in blue. Kendall τ statistic was used to quantify the relationship (centered, top). A linear trend line is displayed for visual reference.",
  "figure_6": "Clonal trajectories of CH mutations during the evolution of 26 subsequent hematologic malignancies. Six CH genes were present in at least 3 patients who subsequently developed a hematologic malignancy that was also sequenced using the MSK IMPACT platform. Vector origins at time zero show CH VAF in blood, and vector termini show VAF in the bone marrow at time of hematologic disease characterization."
