(a) A simple pendulum model is used to illustrate the equivalent model for (b) the moment about the center of the bowl due to gravity, where the force of gravity acting at the center of mass (CoM) of the bowl creates a moment about the center of rotation (CoR). (c) Ranges of restoring torques corresponding to the measurements provided by Rosenbaum and Myer18, as well as the torques resulting from the pendulum model at two nominal stiffnesses.",
  "figure_3": "Determining placement of ball transfer units (BTUs). (a) Depiction of maximal bowl rotation, at which the edge of the bowl loses contact with a BTU. (b) BTU placement that results in the lowest point of the bowl being at the same height as the lowest point on each BTU, with the BTUs placed normal to the bowl’s surface. For clarity, only one BTU is shown. (c) Geometric parameters of the BTUs.",
  "figure_4": "Assembled ball-transfer-unit (BTU) holder and bowl. (a) Top view of the BTU holder on swim goggles, with BTUs inserted. A gap in the BTU holder leaves space for the nose and the bridge of the goggles. (b) Bowl without a brim, rotated by , which is the angle at which it loses contact with a BTU. (c) Bowl with a brim, rotated by . The brim prevents the bowl from losing contact with the BTUs.",

  "figure_6": "Model used to determine maximum-allowable head rotation. (a) The configuration corresponding to the smallest head rotation angle, , at which the bowl will fall off the ball transfer units (BTUs). The center of mass (CoM) of the bowl is located directly above the line connecting the points at which the two lower BTUs contact the bowl. (b) Reference frames used to calculate the rotation of the wearer’s head, , and the rotation of the bowl, , at which the bowl will fall off of the BTUs. Each frame shares the same color as the object(s) to which it is rigidly connected.",
  "figure_7": "The height of the mounted eye, , above the head’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICoR), will be greater than the height of the volunteer’s eye, , which will result in a discrepancy between the movement of the two eyes."
