The filled black circle in the left panel denotes the percentage of the BC-HLA variance explained by the sum of contributions by immunogenicities of individual viruses (column 3 in Table 3). The area of the color-coded viral sectors in the right panel is proportional to individual viral contributions shown in column 3 of Table 3. The sectors of HHV4 and HHV2 (in black) were almost totally overlapping.",
