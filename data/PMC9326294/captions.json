  "figure_1": "Allometric scaling of eye and head size in Macroglossum stellatarum. (a) X-ray microtomography images of two individuals of M. stellatarum. The animal to the left had a body length of 21.8 mm, the right one of 26.5 mm. The scale bar applies to both eyes. The dot colours refer to the body size of the animals from which the eyes were sourced (also shown in (d)). (b) Representative horizontal and (c) vertical section through the centre of the eye (see white and black lines in (a)) with the cornea, crystalline cones, clear zone and retina indicated. (d) Body length of the individuals selected for this study. Allometric scaling of the (e) dorsal-ventral, (f) the anterior-posterior diameter of the eye, and (g) the head size measured from the left to the right base of the mouth parts (electronic supplementary material, figure S2A). (h) To test whether the shape of the eye differed across eye diameters, we measured the distance from the nodal point formed by the edges of the cornea to the corneal surface for nine evenly spaced radii in horizontal sections (see electronic supplementary material, figure S3D–F for frontal ones, see sketch in (i) for colour code). (i) We calculated the ratio between the average lateral radii (light green) and the central radius (dark green) as a proxy for the cornea's shape, and assessed its allometric scaling. (j) The allometric scaling of the median of the central seven radius measurements (green) with eye diameter. (e–g,i,j) Data from individual hawkmoths was measured by either X-ray microtomography (black dots), or light-microscopy (grey dots). The dashed cyan line indicates isometric scaling and the black line represents the allometric scaling relationship. R is the Pearson correlation coefficient of the log-transformed data, and p denotes its statistical significance. Given the significant linear correlations in (e–g,j), the allometric relationship was calculated using reduced major axis regression, with the exponential scaling exponent b, the normalization constant c, and the confidence interval ci of b.

  "figure_2": "Cornea morphology and facet allometry of Macroglossum stellatarum. (a) three-dimensional reconstruction of the facets of an example eye of M. stellatarum (total facets: 7111), with facet diameter indicated by the colour scale in (c), top left: sagittal view, top right: anterior view, bottom: dorsal view. (b) The facet diameter was calculated as the average of 3 measurements across 3 facets each (in light orange), centred on the facet of interest and then divided by the number of facets spanned. (c) Facet diameter distribution of all facets of the eye in (c). (d) Allometric scaling of the median facet diameter of the eyes' main facets (greater than 20 µm), and (e) the total number of facets with eye diameter. The total facet number was estimated by dividing the surface of the eye (approximated by a circular area based on the eye diameter) by the median facet size. (d,e) Data from individual hawkmoths was measured by either X-ray microtomography (black dots), or light-microscopy (grey dots). The dashed cyan line indicates isometric scaling and the black line represents the allometric scaling relationship. R is the Pearson correlation coefficient of the log-transformed data, and p denotes its statistical significance. Given the significant linear correlations in (d) and (e), the allometric relationship was calculated using reduced major axis regression, with the exponential scaling exponent b, the normalization constant c, and the confidence interval ci of b.

  "figure_3": "Retinal morphology and rhabdom scaling. (a) Three-dimensional reconstruction of the rhabdoms in an example retina (with 7560 rhabdoms), with inter-rhabdom distance (IRD) indicated by the colour scale in (b). From left to right: sagittal view, anterior view and dorsal view. (c) The IRD was measured as the average distance between rhabdoms as shown in the inset. Allometric scaling of the IRD. (d) Three-dimensional-reconstruction of the retinal volume of the example eye. (e) Differences in retinal shape assessed as the ratio between retinal volume and surface area across eye diameters. (f) A conserved retinal shape across eye sizes allowed us to use the thickness of the retina as a proxy for the average rhabdom length, calculated as the volume divided by half the surface area. (c,e,f) Data from individual hawkmoths was measured by X-ray microtomography (black dots, n = 7 in (c), n = 10 in (e,f) ). The dashed cyan line indicates isometric scaling and the black line represents the allometric scaling relationship. R is the Pearson correlation coefficient of the log-transformed data, and p denotes its statistical significance. Given the significant linear correlations in (c,f), the allometric relationship was calculated using reduced major axis regression, with the exponential scaling exponent b, the normalization constant c, and the confidence interval ci of b.

  "figure_4": "Model estimation of the allometry of spatial acuity and sensitivity. We used the measured allometric relations of the inter-facet and inter-rhabdom distance D and d, rhabdom length l and focal length f (the latter two scaling isometrically) to calculate (a) the sensitivity of a single ommatidium according to [35], (b) the rhabdom acceptance angle and (c) half-width of the point spread function (PSF), according to [6]. All estimates of eye performance were calculated for body lengths ranging from 12.5 mm to 37.5 mm and normalized to a median-sized animal of 25 mm body length. All calculations were compared to estimates based on an eye in which all parameters scaled isometrically (cyan line). The confidence intervals were computed by applying the same calculations to the scaling parameters (exponent and y-axis intercept) with added and subtracted confidence intervals obtained from the regression analysis. (d) Log-transformed sensitivity, (e) rhabdom acceptance angle, and (f) eye parameter were calculated for a range of scaling exponents applied to the inter-facet and inter-rhabdom distance D and d (see electronic supplementary material, 'Methods'). (d–f) The resulting values are depicted for different eye diameters (with corresponding body lengths indicated in grey), normalized to the highest sensitivity, smallest rhabdom acceptance angle, and largest eye parameter. The measured scaling exponent is indicated by the black line, and isometry by the blue dashed line. The dotted blue line below the x-axis indicates the measured size variation. Variation in (g) log sensitivity, (h) rhabdom acceptance angle, and (i) eye parameter for a given scaling exponent across eye sizes, quantified as the standard deviation (s.d.) for the entire range of eye diameters (grey line), and the measured range (blue dotted line). The black line indicates the measured exponents, and the blue dashed line isometry. (Online version in colour.)"
