      "caption": "Schematic diagram of B cell development. In the bone marrow, partial lymphoid progenitors differentiate into early pro-B cells performing DH\n to JH\n rearrangement, followed by late pro-B cells in which VH\n to DHJH\n rearrangement occurs. After large pre-B cells expressing pre-BCR composed of heavy chains, VpreB1, and λ5, small pre-B cells perform light chain rearrangement. Immature B cells, preceding maturation in the periphery, express mature BCRs composed of heavy and light chains. Activated by antigens, mature B cells differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antibodies. The grey bars represent the expression levels of EBF1, PAX5, and MYC. The darker the color is, the higher the protein expression level is. The image was generated using the online platform https://www.biorender.com.",
