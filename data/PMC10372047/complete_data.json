The second circle indicates the circBase ID of the predominantly enriched circRNAs in exosomes derived from CAFs (orange) or NFs (blue). The third circle shows the log2FC of differentially expressed circRNAs (orange squares for upregulated circRNAs and purple squares for downregulated circRNAs). The fourth circle shows the number of reads the differentially expressed circRNAs matched after normalization (orange circles for CAFs and blue triangles for NFs). B The qRT-PCR analysis showing the circTBPL1 expression in exosomes secreted by NFs and CAFs (left) and that in the corresponding NFs and CAFs (right). C ISH assay was performed to detect the localization of circTBPL1 in breast cancer tissue, and HE staining was used to show the histology. D Schematic illustration showing the genomic location and splicing pattern of circTBPL1. The back-splice junction (red triangle) of circTBPL1was confirmed by sanger sequencing. E cDNA and gDNA of CAFs were amplified using convergent and divergent primers. β-actin was used as the negative control. F The qRT–PCR analysis was used to detect the expression of circTBPL1 and linear TBPL1 in CAFs treated with actinomycin D for indicated time. G The qRT–PCR analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of circTBPL1 and linear TBPL1 in CAFs treated with RNase R. H The expression of circTBPL1 and linear TBPL1 were evaluated by qRT-PCR using random primers or oligo dT primers. I The expression of circTBPL1 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of CAFs was evaluated by qRT–PCR. GAPDH and U6 were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA markers, respectively. J FISH assay was used to detect the subcellular localization of circTBPL1 in CAFs. (ns, no significance, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).",
