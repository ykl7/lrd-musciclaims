  "figure_3": "In IDC, data suggests higher levels of all TILs, including FOXP3+ T cells. T cells in the TIME for IDCs are typically characterized by PD-1+ and LAG3+. Additionally, there are both M1-like and M2-like macrophages present. However, in ILCs, there tends to be increased levels of M2-like macrophages, lower levels of TILs, and T cells characterized by PD-1+ and TIGIT+ compared to IDCs.",
