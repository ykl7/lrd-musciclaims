      "caption": "Graphical overview of factors and mechanisms linking obesity, hematologic malignancy and severe COVID-19 course. Obesity has been linked to carcinogenesis through aberrant cytokine and adipokine production, hyperinsulinemia, increase growth-factor levels (IGF-1), elevated oxidative-stress and chronic low-grade inflammation. Obesity-related comorbidities, along with features accompanying hematologic malignancies, such as quantitative and qualitative immune system defects and telomere shortening, may lead to an inadequate immune response after COVID-19 vaccination and severe clinical outcomes. * This image was derived from the free medical site http://smart.servier.com/ (accessed on 31 March 2022) by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.",
