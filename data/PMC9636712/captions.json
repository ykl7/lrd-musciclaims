A The ACE2 expression profiles of breast cancer samples and normal tissues in the TCGA-BRCA and GTEx database. (Dot plot) Each dot represents the expression of a sample (*P < 0.05). B Western blot analysis showed the expression of ACE2 protein in normal breast cell line (MCF-10A) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-468, MDA-231, T47D, MCF-7, BT-549, SK-BR-3, BT-474). The number below every lane represents the ratio of ACE2/β-actin expression in the Western blot assays. C Expression levels of ACE2 gene in breast cancer, colon colorectal cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer and pancreatic cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). The vertical axis in the figure represents ACE2 expression, the horizontal axis is the cell lines, and the different colors represent the group of cell lines. D ACE2 expression levels in the plasma of all breast cancer patients (n = 111) and healthy controls (n = 20) were measured by ELISA (P = 4.7e−12). E The plasma levels of ACE2 in chemosensitive and insensitive breast cancer patients (P = 3.9e-06).

  "figure_5": "HIF-1α is directly involved in the regulation of chemotherapeutic drug-induced, ROS-mediated ACE2 expression. A Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis showed HIF-1α expression in four breast cancer cells after exposure to 0.05 µM EPI, 500 µM NAC, 0.05 µM EPI + 500 µM NAC for 72 h or 100 µM H2O2 for 4 h. B Western blotting analysis of ACE2 and HIF-1α expression in parental and resistant breast cancer cells cultured under normoxic or hypoxic (1% O2 for 24 h) conditions. The relative expression of proteins is quantified by grayscale analysis and is shown below the bands. C Knockdown of HIF-1α in MDA-468 cells or D inhibition of HIF-1α by YC-1 inhibitor blocked the EPI-induced elevation of ACE2 in breast cancer cells under normoxia or hypoxia. The relative expression of proteins is quantified by grayscale analysis and is shown below the bands. E Western blot analysis showed that both knockdown and inhibition of HIF-1α expression significantly decreased ACE2 expression in drug-resistant breast cancer cells (468/EPR cells). β-actin was used as an internal reference protein. F Western blot analysis showed no change in the protein level of HIF-1α after knockdown of ACE2 in 468/EPR cells and overexpression of ACE2 in MDA-468 cells. β-actin was used as a loading control",

A Western blot analysis of the expression of AKT and p-AKT in MDA-468 cells treated with EPI, NAC, H2O2 or EPI + NAC. B Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by MK2206 completely blocked the expression of ACE2 and HIF-1α in EPI-induced breast cancer cells. C Western blot and D qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of HIF-1α and ACE2 were downregulated in resistant breast cancer cells after inhibition of AKT phosphorylation.

A Western blot and B qRT-PCR assays verified that ACE2 was successfully knocked down by three independent shRNA targeting ACE2 in 468/EPR cells. C Silencing ACE2 in 468/EPR cells significantly increased the sensitivity to EPI compared with shControl and wild-type cells. The IC50 assay was performed by using the CCK-8 based method. D Silencing ACE2 in 468/EPR cells significantly increased cell proliferative activity compared with shControl cells (****P < 0.0001). E Knockdown of ACE2 in 468/EPR cells remarkably increased the formation of cell colonies compared with shControl cells (****P < 0.0001). F EdU cell proliferation assay displayed that knockdown of ACE2 expression resulted in a significant increase in EdU positive rate, indicating higher cell proliferation ability. G Intracellular ROS levels were remarkably increased in ACE2 knockdown 468/EPR cells than in shControl cells. H Intracellular ROS levels were increased approximately 4-fold in 468/EPR-shACE2 cells treated with 0.05 µM EPI for 72 h compared to control cells.

  "figure_10": "Schematic illustration of the relationship between ROS levels and ACE2 during chemotherapy in breast cancer cells. Left panel: In sensitive breast cancer cells with low ROS levels, ACE2 expression is relatively low; when the cells are stimulated by chemotherapeutic agents, ROS production is induced and phosphorylation of AKT is promoted, which in turn upregulates ACE2 expression by enhancing the expression of HIF-1α. Right panel: ACE2 is expressed at high levels in drug-resistant cells and maintains ROS homeostasis by inhibiting the overproduction of ROS. In drug-resistant cells with knockdown of ACE2, anticancer drugs induced a large increase in ROS levels, which induced apoptosis"
