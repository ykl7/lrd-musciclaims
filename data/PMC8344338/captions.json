  "figure_4": "RMS-S2S precision of 2D gaze, for the five eye trackers, and the four types of eyes. Note how much worse precision the EyeLink Gen 2 eyes (E) produce compared to Human (H), SMI (S) and Tobii eyes (T). Default filtering was applied to all trackers in this plot (on for all but the Tobii Spectrum), and data from both stabilized and unstabilized recordings were included",
  "figure_5": "Type precision of 2D gaze, for the five eye trackers, with and without filtering. Data from both stabilized and unstabilized recordings were included. White noise corresponds to Type values near the square root of 2 (indicated with a green line), while coloured noise has values nearer to 0",
  "figure_6": "RMS-S2S precision of 2D gaze, for Static glass head with artificial eyes, artificial eyes on human head (AA) and human eyes in a human head (HH). The SMI artificial eyes were used for all eye trackers, except the Tobii Spectrum, where we used the Tobii artificial eyes. Default filtering was used for all eye trackers",
  "figure_7": "Type of 2D gaze, for Static glass head with artificial eyes, artificial eyes on human head (AA) and human eyes in a human head (HH). The SMI artificial eyes were used for all eye trackers, except the Tobii Spectrum, where we used the Tobii artificial eyes. Default filtering was used for all eye trackers",

  "figure_9": "STD precision of 2D gaze, for the EyeLink1000+ and the Tobii Spectrum, comparing stabilized to non-stabilized participants. The EyeLink II and the HiSpeed240 exhibit a very similar effect to the EyeLink 1000, while the SMI RED250mobile has the same unclear effect of stabilization as the Tobii Spectrum",
  "figure_10": "RMS-S2S of the 2D Pupil center signal (P) and the CR center signal from the processing of the eye camera images. Only SMI eyes were used for static and AA conditions. The unit of RMS-S2S in this figure is camera pixels; with most values in the range 0.02–0.10 px",

  "figure_14": "Horizontal CR, Pupil and Gaze signals from the SMI HiSpeed 240 for a typical 2.5 s translational 2 centimeter movement across the camera (appr. 1.5 px movement of CR and Pupil), and the beginning of the return. During these 2.5 s Gaze moves back and forth, of around half a degree, because Pupil and CR signals behave quite differently despite being recorded from the same artificial eye. For optimal illustration, the CR and Pupil signals have been scaled to fit the size of the Gaze plot"
