      "caption": "Development of vertebrate, spider and cephalopod eyes. (A-D) Generic vertebrate eye (modified from Dash et al., 2015). (A) In all vertebrates, eye development begins with the evagination of the optic primordia (OP) from the diencephalic region of the forebrain. Thereafter, the neuroectodermal OP reorient such that they begin to adopt a vesicle or vesicle-like structure. (B) Lens induction results from an interaction between the optic vesicle (OV) and the overlying surface ectoderm that results in the formation of the lens placode, from which the lens will eventually arise. POM cells invade the eye (red). (C) The OVs undergo a dramatic series of species-dependent morphogenetic movements that generally involve invagination to generate a bilayered optic cup (OC). (D) The OC, through a series of intrinsic regulatory programs and extrinsic cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, segregates into the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina. (E-G) Invagination and morphogenesis of the principal eyes of the spider, Heteropoda venatoria based on Homann (1971). Cross-section view, anterior is left. (E) The principal eye is formed from an invagination of the anterior ectodermal tissue. Invagination starts from the bottom of the future eye, moving upward to make an ‘s’ shape. (F) Three layers of tissue result, the vitreous cells, the photoreceptors and the pigmented cells. (G) A cuticular lens grows over these layers. (H-K) Invagination and internalization of the retina in the squid D. pealeii, as described by Koenig et al. (2016). Cross-section view, anterior is right. (H) Stage 19: retinal placode has formed and lateral lip cells are internalizing the placode. (I) Stage 21: internalization is complete and the eye vesicle is formed. (J) Stage 27: cup-shaped retina and teardrop lens has formed, and corneal tissue begins to grow to internalize the eye. (K) Stage 29: eye is functional (stages as described by Arnold, 1967).",

      "caption": "Retinal architecture in vertebrates, spiders and cephalopods. (A) The vertebrate retina is composed of seven cell types: RGCs, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, rod and cone photoreceptors and Müller glia. These cell types are arranged into three cellular laminae: the ganglion cell layer (GCL); the inner nuclear layer (INL); and the outer nuclear layer (ONL). The laminae are separated by two synaptic layers: the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL). (B) The retina of the spider principal eye is found behind the vitreous cells and is composed of photoreceptor cells, unpigmented glia and pigmented glia. The outer segment (OS) of the photoreceptor cells is anterior to the photoreceptor nuclear layer (PRNL). The unpigmented glial cell nuclei (GCNL) are posterior to the photoreceptors and the pigmented glial cell nuclei (PGL) are at the retinal periphery. Anterior of the eye is up. (C) The secondary retina is also behind a layer of vitreous cells and has a PRNL, an unpigmented glial cell layer (GLCL) and pigmented cells. The nuclei of the photoreceptor cells and unpigmented glia are in the anterior of the retina. The photoreceptor segment (RS) is posterior to the GLCL. An accumulation of pigment is often found behind the RS (PL). This is followed by the photoreceptor intermediate segment (IS) and the pigmented glial cell nuclei. Figure is based on DeVoe et al. (1969), Blest et al. (1980), Blest (1983), Uehara et al. (1994), Schröer (2017) and Grusch et al. (1997). (D) Schematic of the Cephalopod retina (anterior is up). The PRNL and the glial cell/support cell nuclear layer are separated by the basal membrane. The photoreceptors penetrate the membrane and extend their outer segments anterior to the support cell bodies. Photoreceptors also synapse directly on the optic lobe. The support cells extend projections into the outer segment. Both the support cells and photoreceptor cells have pigment granules. Cartoon based on Koenig et al. (2016), Williams (1909) and Saibil (1990).",
