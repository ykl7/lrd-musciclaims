  "figure_1": "Structure and Function of Phytoestrogens on Breast Cancer Stem Cells. (A). Chemical structures of different classes of phytoestrogens compared to 17β-estradiol. Colors highlight different subclasses of phytoestrogens. (B). Phytoestrogens either inhibit or activate different signaling pathways to suppress breast cancer stem cells (BSCS). Specifically, inhibition of hedgehog, CD44 or adipogenesis by genistein, pterostilbene or resveratrol reduces survival of BCSC. Activation of ERβ, DAXX, FAS, argonaute2 or miRNAs by S-equol, genistein, naringenin, resveratrol or pterostilbene suppresses survival of BCSC. Red indicates inhibition of pathways. Blue indicates activation of pathways."
