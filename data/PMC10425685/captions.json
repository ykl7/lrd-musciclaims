  "figure_1": "Hematologic malignancy NGS panel design. (A) Bar chart showing the number of NGS panels offered for hematologic malignancies by responding laboratories, including a single comprehensive cancer panel, a single comprehensive HMP, and 2 or more panels. (B) Bar chart showing the number of genes offered ranging from small panels with 21 to 50 genes to large panels with more than 300 genes. The number of genes offered are further stratified into 3 categories based on the number of NGS panels offered: respondents with single comprehensive cancer panel, respondents with single comprehensive HMP, and combined group of respondents with >1 panel. (C) Bar chart generally showing excellent coverage of myeloid processes with no more than 5 genes needed to be added for most NGS panels. (D) Bar chart showing more moderate coverage of lymphoid processes with wider range of number of genes needed.",

  "figure_3": "Laboratory operations. (A) Bar chart showing the average number of hematologic malignancy NGS panels run per month by responding institutions ranging from <10 cases to 401 to 600 cases per month. (B) Bar chart showing average TAT for acute cases ranging from 2 to 7 calendar days to 15 to 21 calendar days. (C) Bar chart showing different approaches for achieving rapid turnaround times for acute cases. Some institutions reported >1 approach. (D) Bar chart showing ancillary testing methods used to cover NGS limitations. Some institutions reported >1 method."
