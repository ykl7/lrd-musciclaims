Tornado diagram showing the sensitivity analysis for supplemental screening with handheld ultrasound. (A) For people with dense breasts, an increase in the sensitivity of mammography alone or a decrease in the sensitivity of supplemental ultrasound plus mammography decreased the incremental QALYs, resulting in an increase in estimated ICERs. In contrast, the ICERs were decreased when the sensitivity of mammography alone was decreased or the sensitivity of supplemental ultrasound plus mammography was increased. (B) For people with extremely dense breasts, increasing the sensitivity of mammography alone decreased the incremental QALYs, which led supplemental screening with ultrasound to be dominated (more costly, less effective) by mammography alone. A decrease in the sensitivity of supplemental ultrasound plus mammography decreased incremental QALYs and increased incremental costs, resulting in an increase in estimated ICERs.",

Tornado diagram showing the sensitivity analysis for supplemental screening with MRI. (A) For people with dense breasts, the estimated ICERs increased when the sensitivity of mammography alone increased and when the cost of MRI screening increased. Estimated ICERs were also impacted by the relative risk of breast cancer for people with heterogeneously dense breasts compared to people with scattered areas of fibroglandular density. (B) For people with extremely dense breasts, the ICERs were mostly impacted (increased) by a decrease in the sensitivity of mammography plus supplemental MRI and an increase in the sensitivity of mammography alone. and extremely dense breasts (i.e., 1.84 and 2.26 for the lower and upper bound of the 95% CI, respectively, vs. 2.04 for the reference case) compared to people with scattered areas of fibroglandular density (BI-RADS B; Figure 4A). Estimated ICERs were also impacted by the relative risk of breast cancer for people with extremely dense breasts compared to people with scattered areas of fibroglandular density.",

Tornado diagram showing the sensitivity analysis for supplemental screening with DBT. (A) For people with dense breasts, increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of mammography alone had the biggest impact on ICERs. (B) For people with extremely dense breasts, a decrease in the relative risk of breast cancer compared to people with scattered areas of fibroglandular density and a decrease in the sensitivity of supplemental screening with increased estimated ICERs. Screening participation rate and the cost of DBT screening moderately affected estimated ICERs.",

The current scenario would explore resource use and total costs without public funding for supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography. The new scenario would explore resource use and total costs with public funding for supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography using ultrasound, MRI, or DBT. The budget impact would represent the difference in costs between the two scenarios. a Handheld ultrasound used in all analyses except for the scenario analysis with automated breast ultrasound.",
