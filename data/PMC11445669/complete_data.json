b1, b2, and b3 are coefficients estimated through calibration of natural history; V(t) is the volume of the spherical tumour; and V'(t) represents the growth rate of the volume, and is the derivative of V(t).",

b1, b2, and b3 are coefficients estimated through calibration of natural history; V(t) is the volume of the spherical tumour; and V'(t) represents the growth rate of the volume, and is the derivative of V(t).",
