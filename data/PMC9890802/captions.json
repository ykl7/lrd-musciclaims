  "figure_1": "Structural features of T cell receptor versus CAR T cell design. a Structural features of T cell receptor. b Production of CAR T cells from patient-derived T cells. c Structural features of CAR T cell design of different generations. The principal CAR structure includes an extracellular/binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular/signaling domain. The extracellular portion of CAR is typically generated from a monoclonal antibody against the target, which is also known as a single-chain variable fragment (ScFv). The ScFv is affixed to the transmembrane domain that crosses the cell membrane via the hinge/spacer region. Following the recognition and binding of ScFv part of the CAR with tumor antigen, the intracellular/signaling domain comprised of co-stimulators and the CD3ζ chain initiates intracellular signaling. The first-generation CAR contains only immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) motifs in the intracellular domain. The second-generation CAR includes one co-stimulatory molecule, and the third-generation CAR contains two co-stimulatory molecules. The fourth and fifth generations of CARs are based on second-generation CAR. The fourth-generation CAR contains 1–3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs combined with an inducible expressed cytokine; while the fifth-generation CAR is T cell receptor-deficient CAR T cells developed employing genome editing technologies",
  "figure_2": "Multi-antigen targeting CAR T cells that prevent tumor antigen escape to intensify therapeutic attributes. a Bispecific/bivalent ‘OR-gated’ CAR T cells. Each CAR exhibits a comprehensive signal domain that, when present with either alike antigen, intensifies the antitumor activity of CAR T cells. b Bispecific ‘tandem’ CAR T cells. One CAR simultaneously expresses two different antigen-binding domains. c Trivalent ‘OR-gated’ CAR T cells. Three CARs expressing T cells intensify the antitumor effects by recognition of one, two, or three tumor-specific (targeted/validated) antigens. d A mixture of different single-targeted CAR T cells also ensures multi-antigen targeting",
  "figure_3": "A glance at CAR T cell-based therapeutic prospect in brain cancer management. CAR T cells recognize some brain tumor-specific antigens that are targeted with an ambition to eliminate brain cancer cells. Some malignant growths in the brain can damage the BBB and help CAR T cells to cross the BBB to reach the tumor site. In addition, some delivery strategies allow delivering CAR T cells to the tumor site enabling the achievement of better therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor management",
  "figure_4": "An overview of combination therapy with CAR T cells. a Combination of CAR T cells with checkpoint inhibitors. b Combination of CAR T cells with immunosuppressive drugs. c Natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligand-based targeting by natural killer cells coupled with CAR T cells highlights a potential for combinatorial treatment. Extrinsic checkpoint blockade rests on programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor/ligand hindering antibodies. Genetic engineering enables intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockage to express proteins or nucleic acid that disrupt PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. The PD-1 dominant negative receptor, which competes with native PD-1 receptor and inhibits inhibitory signaling through native wild-type receptors, lacks the intracellular signaling domain in its creation. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting single-chain variable fragments (ScFvs), which provide local antibody inhibition of PD-1 receptor/ligand interaction, can also be ensured by CAR T cells. Furthermore, gene-editing techniques can eliminate PD-1 expression by editing the programmed cell death protein 1 gene locus. CAR T cell therapy coupled with immunosuppressants attenuates non-specific toxicities by suppressing inflammation. The usefulness of combination therapy in the treatment of cancer is reinforced by the fact that NKG2D ligand-based targeting of natural killer cells in conjunction with CAR T cells enhances the anticancer effect of CAR T cells"
