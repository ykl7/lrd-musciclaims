The principal CAR structure includes an extracellular/binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular/signaling domain. The extracellular portion of CAR is typically generated from a monoclonal antibody against the target, which is also known as a single-chain variable fragment (ScFv). The ScFv is affixed to the transmembrane domain that crosses the cell membrane via the hinge/spacer region. Following the recognition and binding of ScFv part of the CAR with tumor antigen, the intracellular/signaling domain comprised of co-stimulators and the CD3ζ chain initiates intracellular signaling. The first-generation CAR contains only immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) motifs in the intracellular domain. The second-generation CAR includes one co-stimulatory molecule, and the third-generation CAR contains two co-stimulatory molecules. The fourth and fifth generations of CARs are based on second-generation CAR. The fourth-generation CAR contains 1–3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs combined with an inducible expressed cytokine; while the fifth-generation CAR is T cell receptor-deficient CAR T cells developed employing genome editing technologies",

Extrinsic checkpoint blockade rests on programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor/ligand hindering antibodies. Genetic engineering enables intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockage to express proteins or nucleic acid that disrupt PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. The PD-1 dominant negative receptor, which competes with native PD-1 receptor and inhibits inhibitory signaling through native wild-type receptors, lacks the intracellular signaling domain in its creation. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting single-chain variable fragments (ScFvs), which provide local antibody inhibition of PD-1 receptor/ligand interaction, can also be ensured by CAR T cells. Furthermore, gene-editing techniques can eliminate PD-1 expression by editing the programmed cell death protein 1 gene locus. CAR T cell therapy coupled with immunosuppressants attenuates non-specific toxicities by suppressing inflammation. The usefulness of combination therapy in the treatment of cancer is reinforced by the fact that NKG2D ligand-based targeting of natural killer cells in conjunction with CAR T cells enhances the anticancer effect of CAR T cells",
