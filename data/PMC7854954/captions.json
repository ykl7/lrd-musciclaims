  "figure_1": "Model structure of the whole‐body physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model integrated with a 4‐compartment permeability‐limited brain (4Brain) model, which has 4 compartments representing the brain blood, brain mass, cranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal CSF. The 4Brain model assumes: (1) drug transport across the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) is governed by bidirectional passive permeability (PSB) and ABCB1‐mediated and ABCG2‐mediated active efflux clearance (CLefflux,BBB); (2) drug transport across the blood‐CSF barrier was controlled by bidirectional PSB and ABCB1‐mediated active influx clearance (CLuptake,CSF); (3) drug transport between the brain mass and cranial CSF is diffusive transport at a bi‐directional clearance (PSB); (4) fluid balance is maintained by the circulation of CSF between spinal and cranial compartments and reabsorbed into the brain blood; (5) the cerebral blood flow rate (Q\nBrain) links the 4Brain model to whole‐body model; (6) only unbound and unionized drug can passively pass through all barriers, while transporters act upon unbound drug (including both unionized and ionized species); (7) metabolism in brain mass is negligible; and (8) all compartments are well‐stirred with defined volumes. Flow rates are described by the CSF secretion rate (Q\nBCSFB), bulk flow rate from brain mass to cranial CSF (Q\nbulk), CSF flow rate out of cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nsink), CSF shuttle flow rate between cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nSin and Q\nSout), and water transfer rate from the brain blood to brain mass (Q\nBBB).",
  "figure_2": "The pH‐dependent apparent permeability of the three cyclin D‐cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors across the MDCKII, MDCKII‐ABCB1, and MDCKII‐ABCG2 cell monolayers. Bi‐directional permeability experiments were performed at a fixed apical pH (7.4) and varying basolateral pH (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0). The apparent permeability in the apical‐to‐basolateral (P\napp,A‐B) and basolateral‐to‐apical (P\napp,B‐A) directions and efflux ratio (ER) are expressed as the mean fold change relative to those determined in the control (at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers).",

(a) Simulated and observed unbound ribociclib plasma concentration‐time profiles. (b) Simulated and observed ribociclib cerebrospinal fluid concentration‐time profiles. (c) Simulated unbound ribociclib brain concentration‐time profiles in the human normal brain (with brain pH 7.12 and ABCB1 abundance 3.38 pmol/mg at the BBB).

(f) Simulated unbound ribociclib concentration‐time profiles in brain tumors with pH 6.5 and loss of ABCB1 expression at the BBB. Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population following 5‐day ribociclib treatment at a daily oral dose of 900 mg. Observed clinical plasma and CNS pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 12 glioblastoma patients treated with ribociclib (900 mg q.d. for 5 days).",
