The 4Brain model assumes: (1) drug transport across the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) is governed by bidirectional passive permeability (PSB) and ABCB1‐mediated and ABCG2‐mediated active efflux clearance (CLefflux,BBB); (2) drug transport across the blood‐CSF barrier was controlled by bidirectional PSB and ABCB1‐mediated active influx clearance (CLuptake,CSF); (3) drug transport between the brain mass and cranial CSF is diffusive transport at a bi‐directional clearance (PSB); (4) fluid balance is maintained by the circulation of CSF between spinal and cranial compartments and reabsorbed into the brain blood; (5) the cerebral blood flow rate (Q\nBrain) links the 4Brain model to whole‐body model; (6) only unbound and unionized drug can passively pass through all barriers, while transporters act upon unbound drug (including both unionized and ionized species); (7) metabolism in brain mass is negligible; and (8) all compartments are well‐stirred with defined volumes. Flow rates are described by the CSF secretion rate (Q\nBCSFB), bulk flow rate from brain mass to cranial CSF (Q\nbulk), CSF flow rate out of cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nsink), CSF shuttle flow rate between cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nSin and Q\nSout), and water transfer rate from the brain blood to brain mass (Q\nBBB).",
