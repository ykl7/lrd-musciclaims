  "figure_1": "a Overview of the MSK-IMPACT Heme clinical workflow. Distribution of (b) tumor types profiled by MSK-IMPACT Heme including (c) patient sex by tumor type, and (d) patient-matched normal sample type used for analysis. (e) Variant allele frequency (VAF) of somatic mutations in tumor and matched normal tissues. f Heatmap showing the percentage of patients with tumor somatic mutations observed in matched nail or saliva tissues. The first number in each cell indicates the number of patients where a tumor mutation is observed in the normal comparator, and the second number indicates the total number of patients profiled with the corresponding normal. g Heatmap showing the distribution of genes, where a somatic mutation is found in the tumor and the rate of observing the same variant in the matched normal, indicated with the color-scale. Gray cells indicate that for a given tumor type, either a somatic alteration was not detected in the tumor in that gene or the matched normal sample type (nail or saliva, shown above the heatmap) was not sequenced. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
  "figure_2": "a The distribution of VAF of somatic mutations, host SNPs, and donor SNPs. b Detection of CN-LOH of chromosome 13q, including FLT3. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
  "figure_3": "a Somatic mutational profiles of T cells, plasma cells and unsorted bone marrow highlighting distinct mutation patterns in different populations. b ARID5B structural rearrangement (inversion) detected only in the T cell population. c The unique somatic copy number alteration profiles of sorted T cells and plasma cells compared to unsorted bone marrow further support that these populations are clonally distinct. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
  "figure_4": "a Recurrent somatic alterations across common tumor types and pathways in lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms. b Bars indicate the percentage of cases harboring different classes of genomic alterations, with integration of mutation and allele specific copy number status. c Genome-wide somatic copy number (SCNA) profiles in main tumor types. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
  "figure_5": "a Prevalence of somatic mutations across main tumor types and the mutational spectra. The median TMB for each tumor type is indicated by a red line. b Mutational signatures, sorted by dominant signature for the 261 tumors with elevated mutation burden (>12.9 Mut/Mb). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
  "figure_6": "a Percentage of samples across all tumor types that harbor a mutation considered clinically actionable according to the OncoKB therapeutic levels of evidence. b Distribution of IPSS-M algorithm calculated scores and risk categories identified in the 101 cases in the MSK-IMPACT Heme cohort. In the box plots, the central line represents the median; the box corresponds to 25–75% quartiles; the upper whisker extends to the largest value no farther than 1.5× IQR; and the lower whisker extends from the 25% quartile to the smallest value no farther than 1.5× IQR. c The number of patients in the MSK-IMPACT Heme MDS cohort with the given genomic alteration and their stratification into IPSS-M risk categories. Source data are provided as a Source Data file."
