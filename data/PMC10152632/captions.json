  "figure_1": "ExomiRNAs and the diagnosis of hematologic neoplasms. After the blood is obtained from the subject, it can be used for detection. The microfluidic approach is one the most accurate ways of detection (demonstrated in the figure as a microfluidic chip). These malignancies have their specific miRNA as the tumor marker. Here four disorders (AML: Acute myeloid leukemia, CML: Chronic myeloid leukemia, CLL: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and MM: Multiple myeloma) have been illustrated",
  "figure_2": "The role of exomiRNAs in the pathogenesis of hematologic neoplasms. Cancer cells could release exosomes filled with miRNAs with mRNA-interfering potential in target cells. The miRNAs could also harbor antiapoptotic proteins and promote angiogenesis along with improving the immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and manipulating the tumor microenvironment",
  "figure_3": "Different approaches for treating hematologic neoplasms through exosomes. Blood is drawn from the patient and exosomes will be isolated and then modified. Modified exosomes with specific miRNA and oligonucleotides cargos either obtained from patient or synthesized could be locally injected or systemically delivered. These cargos could 1) Inhibit oncomiRNAs in cancer cells by complementary oligonucleotide attachment, 2) Induce robust T cell response against tumors via dendritic cells (DCs) filled with modified exosomes, and 3) Suppress tumor growth by knocking out the target oncogene"
