In the developing eye, individual miRNA(s) are misexpressed using the Gal4/UAS Target system, and their effect on eye phenotype is assayed. (B) The adult eye of an ey-Gal4 control, to which misexpressed miRNA(s) phenotypes were compared. (C) The domain of expression (UAS GFP, green) of ey-GAL4 in the third-instar larval eye-antennal imaginal disc stained for Discs large (Dlg, blue), to mark cellular outlines, and Elav (red), to mark photoreceptor neurons. (D,E) Gain of function of miR-137 in the developing eye using ey-Gal4 driver (ey>miR-137) results in the reduced-eye phenotype, as seen in (D) adults and (E) larval eye imaginal disc. (F,L,P) Quantification of adult eye surface area (μm2) using Fiji/ImageJ software with statistical analysis of normalized adult eye surface area (150 pixels/inch) carried out using an unpaired Student's t-test. The analyzed area is indicated with white dotted lines for denoted genotypes (B,D,H,J) (n=10). (G,M) Adult eye phenotype frequency of indicated genotypes (n=200, three replicates). Analysis was carried out using a two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison test. (H) Adult eye of the eyg-Gal4 driver serves as a control.

(N,O) Adult eyes of Canton-S control (N) and miR-137KO homozygous (O) flies, which exhibit an enlarged eye phenotype. (Q) The log2 fold-change values of miR-137 normalized to 2S-rRNA in ey-Gal4, ey>miR-137 and miR-137KO. Pairwise comparisons were made with an unpaired t-test. miR-137 is expressed in the developing eye. All graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.3.1. Data are mean±s.e.m. Statistical significance is indicated in each graph: ****P<0.0001; **P<0.01; *P<0.05; ns, non-significant. Orientation of all the imaginal discs is posterior to the left and dorsal upwards. All eye-antennal imaginal discs were captured at 20× magnification and adult eyes at 10× magnification, unless specified otherwise. Scale bars: 100 µm.",

(A-C) All eye-imaginal discs are stained for Myc (green) and Elav (red). (G) Statistical analyses of normalized adult eye surface area (pixels/inch) were carried out using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test for (A) ey-Gal4, (C) ey> RasV12+ scribRNAi and (E) ey> miR-137+RasV12+ scribRNAi (n=10 per genotype).

(H) Average intensity of Myc levels within the three backgrounds: (1) ey-Gal4, (2) ey> RasV12+ scribRNAi and (3) ey>miR-137+ RasV12+ scribRNAi. The signal intensity of Myc was calculated in three region of interest per disc within a sample of n=5 for each genotype. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student's t-test for independent samples. Myc intensity was significantly reduced in the ey>miR-137+ RasV12+ scribRNAi background. (I) Relative transcriptional (expression) levels of Myc using the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in ey-Gal4, ey>RasV12+scribRNAi and ey> RasV12+scribRNAi+miR-137 backgrounds. Statistical analysis was carried out in triplicate, using an unpaired Student's t-test for independent samples. Myc transcript levels were significantly increased in ey>RasV12+scribRNAi compared to ey-Gal4 and decreased in ey> RasV12+scribRNAi+miR-137 background compared to ey-Gal4. (J,K) Eye-antennal imaginal disc of (J) ey-Gal4 and (K) ey>miR-137 stained for phospho-histone 3 (pH3) (green, a marker for cell division) and Elav (red). (L) Statistical analysis of pH3 counts in the retinal field marked by Elav in comparable region of interest in ey-Gal4 (n=5) and ey>miR-137 (n=5) shows a significant difference in proliferating cells between control and ey>miR-137. The statistical analysis was carried out using an unpaired Student's t-test. Quantification of pH3 and eye-surface area was calculated using Fiji/ImageJ software to assay the differences. Data are mean±s.e.m. Statistical significance is indicated in each graph: ****P<0.0001; ***P<0.001; **P<0.01; *P<0.05. All graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.3.1. All the imaginal discs are oriented posterior to the left and dorsal upwards. All eye-antennal imaginal discs were captured at 20× magnification and adult eyes at 10× magnification unless specified otherwise. Scale bars: 100 µm.",
