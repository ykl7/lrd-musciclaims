      "caption": "Effect of DEX on IOP. (a) The mean ± SEM of ∆IOP of ETH (vehicle control), DEX-treated responder and non-responder eyes were plotted over time. The eye pressure of the anterior segments in culture was acquired using Power Lab data acquisition system (AD Instruments, NSW, Australia) and analyzed using LabChart Pro software (ver.8.1) as described in detail in methods section. The basal IOP on day 0 (before DEX treatment) was set at 0 mmHg. In 100 nM dose group, treatment with DEX showed a significant elevated IOP in 6/16 eyes (Mean ± SEM—mΔIOP: 15.50 ± 1.96 mmHg; Response rate: 37.5%) whereas in 500 nM dose group, 3/15 eyes showed a very significant elevated IOP (Mean ± SEM—mΔIOP: 10 ± 0.84 mmHg; Response rate: 20%). ETH treated eyes showed mean ± SEM—mΔIOP of 0.92 ± 0.54 mmHg. Data were analyzed by unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test on each treatment day. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001; ***p < 0.0001; ****p < 0.00001. Frequency Plot of the (b) IOP data and (c) Outflow facility data. The m∆IOP and outflow facility of ETH treated, DEX-responder and DEX-non-responder groups were plotted for both 100 and 500 nM dose groups. The m∆IOP was increased after DEX treatment in responder eyes as compared to non-responder and ETH-treated eyes whereas outflow facility was decreased significantly after DEX treatment (100 and 500 nM) in responder group as compared to non-responder and ETH-treated groups.",
