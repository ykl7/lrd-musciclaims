  "figure_1": "Effect of DEX on IOP. (a) The mean ± SEM of ∆IOP of ETH (vehicle control), DEX-treated responder and non-responder eyes were plotted over time. The eye pressure of the anterior segments in culture was acquired using Power Lab data acquisition system (AD Instruments, NSW, Australia) and analyzed using LabChart Pro software (ver.8.1) as described in detail in methods section. The basal IOP on day 0 (before DEX treatment) was set at 0 mmHg. In 100 nM dose group, treatment with DEX showed a significant elevated IOP in 6/16 eyes (Mean ± SEM—mΔIOP: 15.50 ± 1.96 mmHg; Response rate: 37.5%) whereas in 500 nM dose group, 3/15 eyes showed a very significant elevated IOP (Mean ± SEM—mΔIOP: 10 ± 0.84 mmHg; Response rate: 20%). ETH treated eyes showed mean ± SEM—mΔIOP of 0.92 ± 0.54 mmHg. Data were analyzed by unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test on each treatment day. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001; ***p < 0.0001; ****p < 0.00001. Frequency Plot of the (b) IOP data and (c) Outflow facility data. The m∆IOP and outflow facility of ETH treated, DEX-responder and DEX-non-responder groups were plotted for both 100 and 500 nM dose groups. The m∆IOP was increased after DEX treatment in responder eyes as compared to non-responder and ETH-treated eyes whereas outflow facility was decreased significantly after DEX treatment (100 and 500 nM) in responder group as compared to non-responder and ETH-treated groups.",

High deposition of extracellular debris was found in DEX-treated eyes (indicated in black color arrow) (v, vi) as compared to vehicle-treated eyes (iv). (b) Representative images showing TUNEL positivity in (i) positive control (DNAase I treated), (ii) 0.1% ETH treated eyes, (iii) 100 nM DEX (iv) 500 nM DEX treated eyes and (v) Graph showing the percentage of TUNEL positive cells in ETH (n = 6), 100 nM DEX (n = 6) and 500 nM DEX-treated eyes (n = 6). No significant toxicity was observed after DEX treatment. The TUNEL positivity is indicated in red color arrow. TM-Trabecular meshwork; SC-Schlemm’s canal and CB- Ciliary body.",
  "figure_3": "Effect of DEX on Myocilin and Fibronectin Expression in HOCAS-TM Tissues. Representative confocal images of (a) myocilin and (b) fibronectin expression (green) in ETH (Vehicle)-treated (i,v), DEX-responder (ii, vi), non-responder (iii, vii) eyes and negative control (no primary antibody) (iv, viii), DAPI (Blue): Nuclear counterstain. (c) Quantification of mean fluorescence intensity of myocilin and fibronectin expression in HOCAS-TM tissues of ETH- treated (n = 7), DEX-responder (n = 7) and non-responder eyes (7–9). Fluorescence images of five consecutive sections of TM from DEX treated and vehicle control eyes were analyzed and quantified for myocilin and fibronectin expression (green) in TM using Image J software [https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/]. A significant increase in mean fluorescence intensity of myocilin (p = 0.0002) and fibronectin (p = 0.04) was found in GC responder eyes as compared to vehicle-treated eyes. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; ****p < 0.00001; Un-paired t test. TM-Trabecular meshwork; SC-Schlemm’s canal and CB-Ciliary body."
