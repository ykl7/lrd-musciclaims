  "figure_1": "Schematic outlining the selection process of MDS trials. A total of 464 trials were selected for further screening after initial search results; 191 trials were included in the final analysis. Most trials incorporated MDS with AML.",
  "figure_2": "Most common inclusion criteria in early-phase vs late-phase trials. There is a significant difference between early- and late-phase trials for inclusion criteria categorized as expected survival, bone marrow blasts, transfusion requirements, and washout periods.",
  "figure_3": "Most common exclusion criteria in early-phase vs late-phase trials. There is a significant difference between early- and late-phase trials for exclusion criteria categorized as liver function tests, chronic viral illness, and prior treatments.",
  "figure_4": "Overall concordance and discordance of eligibility criteria with drug safety signals. A safety signal (SS) is defined as the presence of a potential drug safety issue as identified by literature and pharmacist review. A limit is defined as eligibility criteria that is restrictive. The presence or absence of SS and limits for the following variables in each trial were assessed: EF, QTc limits, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, creatinine, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. Stacked bars show concordance (shades of blue) and discordance (red and orange) between eligibility criteria and relevant drug safety signals. Numbers within the bars indicate the number of trials."
