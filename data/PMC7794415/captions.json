  "figure_1": "a Cumulative data collection from May 2016 to September 2016. Participants recruited between May and September 2016 were included in the training set. The gray line is the total number of participants from European ancestry. BCC, SCC, and melanoma prediction models were trained on participants 30–90 years old (black line). b Number of skin cancer cases in the training set. c Overview of prediction model construction in the training set. d Disease risk scores and predictive performances evaluated in the validation set.",
  "figure_2": "The training set included 103,008 participants (14,898 BCC, 7479 SCC, and 3998 melanoma cases). a Risk factors are organized and presented by risk scores. The 5 ancestry PCs are not shown. The variance explained is the deviance of the model, a standard measure of goodness of fit of the model that approximates the variance explained. Deviances were recalculated in the full models, after ranking the risk factors in each skin cancer, based on the deviance explained by each individual risk factor, from the larger to the smaller deviances. ** Indicates risk factors that were not included in the cancer survey, and were identified from the wider 23andMe database. b A sample of risk factor effects (estimated effects and 95% CI). Continuous risk factors, age, and BMI, were modeled as polynomial variables.",
  "figure_5": "The expected ages of diagnosis (mean and SD) were computed using yearly incidence rates derived from the lifetime risk curves, and assuming CDC survival estimated rates, in White American, for the year 2017 (see “Methods” for details). The observed ages of diagnosis (mean and SD) were calculated in the validation set (88,924 participants, see Supplementary Table 1)."
