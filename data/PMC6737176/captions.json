(A) Treatment scheme of mice bearing NSCG-GBMs or NFpp10-GBMs with peptide-tagged micelles. (B) Immunohistochemical analysis of NSCG-GBM after micelle injection. FAM-labelled micelles were injected without peptide (control, Ctrl) or tagged with RGR-FAM, CGKRK-FAM or NGR-FAM peptides (green), and peptide-covered (yellow) CD31+ (red) tumour vessels were quantified; n=2, 200–400 blood vessels/mouse, ***p < 0.0001. (C) Quantitative analysis of peptide-loaded micelles in relation to blood vessels in NFpp10-GBM as in (B); n=2 mice/group, 200–400 blood vessels/mouse. *p =0.022, ***p < 0.0001, ANOVA. Arrows point to some blood vessels with bound peptides. (D) Representative images of FAM-peptide homing to normal brain (control). Scale bars: 50 μm. i.v., intravenous.",
  "figure_4": "LIGHT–CGKRK treatment improves endothelial barrier integrity and vessel function. (A) NFpp10-GBM mice were left untreated (Untr) or treated for 2 weeks with LIGHT–CGKRK (LC). VE-cadherin expression in tumours was quantitatively (upper) and qualitatively (lower) assessed by IHC. Arrowheads point to gaps in disjointed adherens junctions, and arrows point to continuous VE-cadherin+ adherens junctions; n=3, **p =0.0032. Dashed outlines (grey, upper) indicate the areas enlarged below, and dashed white lines (below) indicate junctional areas quantified as VE-cadherin fluorescence (in pixels, same exposure for all groups) at various positions (horizontal axis) along the cell adherens junctions. (B) Assessment and quantification of intratumoural hypoxia by immunohistological detection of pimonidazole-positive areas (red) in treatment groups; n=3, **p =0.0028. (C and D) Expression of ICAM-1 (C) or VCAM-1 (D) on GBM tumour vessels with and without LC treatment, analysed by IHC and quantified; n=3, *p =0.027, **p =0.0014. Student’s t-test. Scale bars: 50 μm.",

(A) LIGHT–CGKRK or triple treatment (LIGHT–CGKRK + anti-VEGF + anti-PD-L1) scheme in C56BL/6 mice harbouring established NFpp10-GBM. (B) NFpp10-GBM mice were left untreated (Untr), or treated for 2 weeks with LIGHT–CGKRK (LC) as a single reagent or combined with anti-VEGF/anti-PD-L1 treatment (Triple). Tumours were analysed for the presence of the HEV marker MECA79 (green) and overlayed (yellow) with CD31+ (red) endothelial cells and total CD31+ vascularity; n=3, *p =0.0086, **p =0.0035, ***p < 0.0001. (C) Treatment groups as in (A) were assessed by IHC for MECA79+ HEVs (green) and CD3+ T cells (red), and T-cell infiltration into tumours was quantified; n=3, *p =0.023, ***p < 0.0001.

(A) Immunohistochemical analysis of CD105+ tumour blood vessels (red) in grade IV GBM and grade I meningioma (for specimen details see Table 1).
