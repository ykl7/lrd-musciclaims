  "figure_1": "CAMP mRNA and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide is upregulated in breast cancer. (A) CAMP expression data in normal controls and breast cancer tumor tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database; (B) CAMP mRNA expressions in normal controls, breast cancer patients’ tumor tissues and tumor adjacent normal tissues; (C) CAMP mRNA expression in normal controls and breast cancer patients’ plasma; (D) serum concentration of peptide LL-37 in normal controls, DCIS, and breast cancer patients; (E) serum LL-37 levels of pre-/post-operation breast cancer patients. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 indicates statistically different.

  "figure_5": "CAMP played an important role in the transition from M0 to M2 macrophages. (A) Non-specific macrophages were differentiated from THP-1 cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment; (B) flow cytometry result showed that CD68+ve cells population increased upon PMA treatment; (C) immunofluorescence (IF) staining of CD68 and CAMP in differentiated macrophages from THP-1 cells; (D) IF staining of CAMP, CD68, and ARG-1 in macrophage co-cultured with breast cancer cells; (E) Western blotting showed that iNOS decreased while ARG-1 and CAMP increased in macrophage during co-culture with breast cancer cells; (F) ARG-1 protein expression decreased and iNOS decreased in CAMP-deficient macrophages co-cultured with breast cancer cells compared to control group; (G) mRNA expression levels of CAMP, M2 marker CD163, CAMP-specific receptor P2X7, and IGF-1R were increased in macrophages cultured in conditioned medium. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 indicates statistically different.",
  "figure_6": "CAMP contributed in the interaction between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer cells. (A) Cell proliferation ability was significantly enhanced in both breast cancer cells after co-culture with TAMs but not with CAMP-deficient macrophages; (B) both CAMP and its receptor P2X7 expressions were upregulated in breast cancer cells after co-cultured with TAMs; (C) IF staining showed increased immunofluorescence intensity of CAMP and decreased intensity of CDH1 in breast cancer cells co-cultured with TAMs; (D) Western blot analysis showed CAMP protein level increased with time in breast cancer cells co-cultured with macrophages; (E) secreted CAMP protein level was detected by ELISA in co-culture medium of macrophages and breast cancer cells; (F) qRT-PCR and (G) IF staining showed that upregulation of ARG-1/CD163 induced in macrophages after co-culture with cancer cells was abrogated by CAMP knockdown. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 indicates statistically different.",
  "figure_7": "CAMP is essential for the tumor promoting effect of TAMs in vivo. (A) Western blotting confirmed CAMP is upregulated in stable T47D CAMP overexpressing cells; (B) secreted CAMP protein level was higher in CAMP overexpressing cells’ culture medium than in the control group; (C) CAMP overexpression increased cell viability in breast cancer cells; (D) more colonies were observed in the CAMP overexpressing group than the control group; (E) CAMP overexpression groups exhibited larger tumor volumes than the control group; (F) the tumor promoting effect of TAMs was abolished by A438079; (G) CD163 mRNA expression in mice tissues; (H) IHC staining of human CD68 expression in mice tumors. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 indicates statistically different."
