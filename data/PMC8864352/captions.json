  "figure_1": "Schematic of the breast cancer epithelial cell and extracellular environment. (a) Breast cancer epithelial cells express different combinations of RTKs including EGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, IGFR and FGFRs, all with a known role in breast cancer. Furthermore, breast cancer epithelial cells express either HER2, or progesterone/oestrogen receptors or none of these s three receptors in HER2-positive, ER/PR-positive and triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), respectively. (b) The breast cancer extracellular environment is composed of fibroblasts, adipocytes, immune cells, and proteins of the extracellular matrix and of the extended vasculature. Cells and proteins are not to scale.",
  "figure_3": "Mechanisms of regulation of FGFR signalling. Schematic of the main regulatory mechanisms of FGFR signalling, including ligand concentration and availability in the extracellular environment, the presence of co-partners on the plasma membrane, signalling inhibitors and signal localization.",
  "figure_4": "Roles of the FGFR family in breast cancer. Schematic of breast cancer extracellular environment (from figure 1) and breast cancer epithelial cells (from figures 1 and 2). The asterisks indicate the three main FGFR isoforms with a critical role in breast cancer progression. The text in burgundy indicates the mechanisms underlying FGFR roles in breast cancer, including secretion of FGFs, interactions with proteins of the extracellular matrix, regulation of vasculature during angiogenesis, crosstalk with HER2, regulation of signalling, metabolism and transcription, changes in intracellular localization, and genomic alterations, as described in the main text. The black lines on the ‘FGF’ text indicate the lack of available information on the role of those specific FGFs in breast cancer."
