Upon stimulation by cytokines or chemokines, such as CSF-1, IL-34, CCL-2, etc., these cells undergo a transformation into TAMs. Subsequently, TAMs manifest diverse phenotypes influenced by polarisation, specifically differentiating into M1-like and M2-like macrophages, each assuming distinct roles. Moreover, M2-like macrophages can be further subdivided into four subtypes: M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d.",

TAMs not only function as inhibitors for the cytotoxic effects of CD8+ T cells by expressing various immune checkpoint ligands in direct contact with them, but they also release a range of cytokines, particularly TGF-β and IL-10, which impact the functions of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, DCs, and Tregs. Additionally, TAMs collaborate with MDSCs and Tregs to exert immunosuppressive effects. Ultimately, TAMs play a central role in shaping an immunosuppressive TME that aids in the tumor's ability to evade the immune system.",

Among the strategies for TAM reprogramming, five major approaches have emerged, including interfering with CSF-1/CSF-1R signalling, agonising CD40, inhibiting PI3Kγ, agonising TLR, and blocking CD47/SIRPα interaction. These approaches restore the original functions of macrophages, such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation, while also enhancing the tumor-killing capabilities of NK cells and CD8+ T cells, thereby achieving a dual antitumor effect through innate and adaptive immunity. Numerous small molecule drugs and biologics based on these therapeutic strategies are currently either available on the market or undergoing clinical trials, highlighting the prominent position of TAM reprogramming as a promising therapeutic approach.",
