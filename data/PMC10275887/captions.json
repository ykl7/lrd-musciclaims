  "figure_1": "The babies were held in the modified ‘flying baby position’ with one arm supporting the chest/chin and the other hand supporting the head.",
  "figure_2": "A (Right eye) B (Left eye): Both eyes Aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP) with looping and shunting. Right eye is more aggressive with areas of vitreous condensation and neovascularization. C (Right eye) D (Left eye): Both eyes APROP with preretinal, sub-hyaloid haemorrhage and plastered fibrin. Inferior lid artefacts were seen in both eyes fundus image.",
  "figure_3": "A (Right eye) B (Left eye): Both eyes APROP with preretinal haemorrhage. Right eye shows plastered fibrin along the arcades. C (Right eye) D (Left eye): Both eyes 1week status post Anti VEGF for APROP (case number 7). Both eyes show reduced plus disease and right eye shows preretinal haem. Right eye single image measured from the centre gives widefield 133-degree wide by 133-degree high field of view. Left eye 2 images stitched to give ultra-widefield 200-degree wide in one of the dimensions and by 133-degree high in the other dimension.",
  "figure_4": "A (Right eye) B (Left eye): Both eyes Zone 2 stage 3 plus disease with ridge lift (Threshold ROP). C (Left eye): Left eye stage 4B ROP with TRD of fovea and disc drag noted. D (Left eye): Fresh peripheral laser marks post laser to the TRD just before taking the baby for vitreoretinal surgery.",
  "figure_5": "A (Right eye) B (Left eye): Both eyes APROP with severe looping, shunting. Montage of 2 images stitched together in both eyes. Lid artefacts are noted in the images."
