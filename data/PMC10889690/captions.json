Examples of the use of liposomes, metal nanoparticles, and polymer nanoparticles, as well as nanotubes and nanofibrins, indicate the wide spectrum of biological activity of these compounds. The use of nanotechnology clearly increases the efficiency of classical chemotherapy by inter alia improving chemotherapeutic delivery systems, targeted therapies or combination therapies [70,71,72,73]."
