  "figure_1": "A. Two pachydrusen larger than 125 μm with irregular borders are observed in colour fundus photography (CFP). Pachydrusen at the upper position is a single form and pachydrusen at the lower position is a clustered form (arrowheads). There are no concurrent other types of drusen, macular pigmentary abnormalities, macular neovascularization, and geographic atrophy. B Two pachydrusen are located inside of the outermost ring of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid with a radius of 3000 µm. C, D Spectral domain optical coherence tomography images demonstrate that two pachydrusen are sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) deposits (arrows).",

There are concurrent soft drusen and macular pigmentary abnormalities without macular neovascularization and geographic atrophy. B Two pachydrusen are located inside of the outermost ring of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid with a radius of 3000 µm. C, D Spectral domain optical coherence tomography images demonstrate that two pachydrusen are sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) deposits (arrows).",
  "figure_3": "A Colour fundus photography showed three pachydrusen (arrowheads), a few retinal haemorrhages, focal elevated lesions, and macular pigmentary abnormalities. There was no concurrent other types of drusen. B Three pachydrusen are located inside of the outermost ring of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid with a radius of 3000 µm. C Pachydrusen was located under the retinal pigment epithelium on the spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images (arrow). D SD-OCT shows pigment epithelial detachment and double-layer sign, which are typical characteristics of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). The subfoveal choroidal thickness at the foveal centre was measured at 314 μm. E Fluorescein angiography shows stippled hyperfluorescences characteristic of occult macular neovascularization with localized hyperfluorescence and hypofluorescence. F Indocyanine green angiography shows an abnormal vascular branching network and multiple polypoid lesions, indicating the occurrence of PCV."
