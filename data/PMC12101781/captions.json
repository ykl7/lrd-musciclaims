  "figure_1": "A) Vascular anastomoses. B) Coaptation of the optic nerve. C) Lateral and D) frontal view of recipient at PO week 4. Note the comparable color in the eyes and ears between both sides, indicative of restoration of blood flow. E) Schematic of optic nerve coaptation, venous cuff anastomosis, and insetting of the flap. General topography of the nerve was maintained during coaptation of the nerve.",
  "figure_4": "A) An elliptical incision is made with a linear extension for exposure of the carotid artery and external jugular vein. B) Skin around the eye and auricle is included. C) Part of the temporal bone is left with the flap to protect the pterygopalatine and ophthalmic arteries and part of the trigeminal nerve posterior to the orbital content is preserved to protect the pterygopalatine artery running beneath its membrane. D) Schematic of donor flap.",
  "figure_3": "Representative images demonstrate gross maintenance of ocular structures in transplanted eyes from PO 1-7 weeks following WET. Measurements of SD-OCT scans for B) central corneal thickness (CCT) and C) total retinal thickness (TRT) are plotted for native and transplanted eyes relative to naïve measurements. Following WET, transplant eye CCT was thicker relative to native or naïve eyes, with TRT thinning of the transplanted retina that was particularly apparent within the anterior hyperreflective layer."
