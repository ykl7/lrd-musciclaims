(A) Perception of a given trial with targets (vertical Gabors) in the trained eye and distractors (horizontal Gabors) in the untrained eye under dichoptic viewing through a mirror stereoscope. (B) The temporal sequence of a given trial in perceptual learning sessions. A random array of highly visible Gabor patches was presented in the trained eye with vertical Gabors (targets) and in the untrained eye with horizontal Gabors (distractors) followed by a 200 ms noise mask. A 500 ms-valid attentive cue preceded each trial indicating which eye would get the targets. The trials were self-initiated and participants were requested to respond as accurately as possible with no time limit and no feedback was given.",
