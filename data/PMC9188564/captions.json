  "figure_1": "Illustration of perceptual learning stimuli. (A) Perception of a given trial with targets (vertical Gabors) in the trained eye and distractors (horizontal Gabors) in the untrained eye under dichoptic viewing through a mirror stereoscope. (B) The temporal sequence of a given trial in perceptual learning sessions. A random array of highly visible Gabor patches was presented in the trained eye with vertical Gabors (targets) and in the untrained eye with horizontal Gabors (distractors) followed by a 200 ms noise mask. A 500 ms-valid attentive cue preceded each trial indicating which eye would get the targets. The trials were self-initiated and participants were requested to respond as accurately as possible with no time limit and no feedback was given.",
  "figure_2": "Selective visual attention with trained and untrained tasks pre- and post-perceptual learning (PL). (A) Group mean of attention improvement with trained tasks (searching/counting performance). Colors denote the group. Error bars denote SEM. Dashed lines indicate 1:1 ratio between reported and displayed number of Gabors. Solid curves are the fits of a variant of the Weibull function. (B) Comparison of Weibull function fit results from individual participants in trained tasks pre- and post-PL with the fit parameters η (left 2 panels) and β (right 2 panels). Data below the dashed line (1:1 ratio of pre- and post-PL) for parameter η and above the dashed line for parameter β indicate improvement after training. (C) Comparison of Max. Gabor count from individual participants pre- and post-PL. Data above the dashed lines indicate improved performance in the trained tasks. Four participants who did not complete 16 PL sessions are marked with open symbols for the AE in the left panel and with filled symbols for the FE in the third panel in (B) and (C). Participants who were tested repeatedly across PL sessions in “Results” section “Correlation of task-related selective attention and interocular suppression/visual acuity across perceptual learning sessions” were identified by different symbols in the second and fourth panels of (C). (D) Individual data for the improvement of attentional modulation in neuronal populations of IPS and V1 with the untrained tasks measured by source-imaged SSVEP. Error bars denote SEM. *, and ** denote p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. Black asterisks indicate paired tests and colored asterisks indicate one-sample tests. Statistical analysis included all participants. Extended data for (A) and (C) with searching and counting errors are shown in Fig. S1.",
  "figure_6": "Relation of improvements in Max. Gabor count, Supp. Index and logMAR within-subjects across perceptual learning sessions. Correlation of the improvement in Max. Gabor count with the improvements in Supp. Index (A) and logMAR acuity (B) in the amblyopic eye of each individual participant across perceptual learning sessions re-plotted from the data in Fig. S2. (C) Correlation of Supp. Index with logMAR acuity re-plotted from the data in (A) and (B). The R values shown in each panel indicate Pearson’s coefficients. Correlation of the improvement in Max. Gabor count in the fellow eye with the improvements in Supp. Index and logMAR acuity across perceptual learning sessions is shown in Supplementary Information (Fig. S3).",
  "figure_7": "Correlation of task-performance bias index and Supp. Index and logMAR acuity. (A) Averaged task-performance bias index across 7 participants from the data in Supplementary Information (Fig. S4) correlated with perceptual learning sessions. Error bars denote SEM. Correlation of task-performance bias index with Supp. Index (B) and with logMAR acuity of the amblyopic eye (C) summarized from individual data in Fig. S4. The yellow area indicates attentional allocation bias towards the fellow eye; the gray area indicates attentional allocation bias towards the amblyopic eye. The correlations were tested by Spearman's coefficient because of non-parametric data with bias index."
