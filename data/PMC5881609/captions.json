  "figure_1": "DNA sources for MRD detection in hematologic malignancies. Graphic overview of distinct DNA sources for molecular disease profiling in hematologic neoplasms, which include circulating tumor DNA as part of the circulating cell-free DNA pool and circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream as well as malignant cells in the BM compartment. Their main characteristics and role in hematologic cancers are displayed in the table next to the graphic.",
  "figure_2": "Detection limits of methods used for DNA identification in PB and BM. Diagrams depicting the range of detection of methods used for identification of cellular DNA in PB and BM (A) and cell-free DNA in plasma (B). PB input material for each assay was considered from a normal 10 mL EDTA vacutainer. aAnalytical sensitivity highly depends on panel width, sequencing depth, and technical conditions (eg, barcoding, duplex sequencing). bAnalytical sensitivity substantially varies depending on the target/targets interrogated and number of input genomes. cAnalytical sensitivity depends on the method used and number of markers tested. WES, whole exome sequencing; WGS, whole genome sequencing."
