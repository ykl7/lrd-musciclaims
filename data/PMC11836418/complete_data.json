Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent tumors in women, and its occurrence is associated with a multitude of factors, such as genetic mutations, late menopause, and obesity. The progression of breast cancer is shaped by numerous factors, encompassing both tumor cell characteristics and elements within the tumor microenvironment, whether cellular or non-cellular. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in diagnostic technologies for breast cancer. Alongside traditional imaging techniques and pathological diagnosis methods, liquid biopsy, and multiple immunofluorescence assays, digital pathology approaches are gradually being incorporated into clinical practice. Treatment options for breast cancer are diverse, and recent clinical studies emphasize the importance of individualized and precision treatments. Long-term follow-up management of breast cancer patients is also crucial, as it may impact both the therapeutic outcomes and enhancing patients’ quality of life.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) started the new era of endocrine therapy for HR+/HER2− breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors are another novel treatment strategy for HR+/HER2− breast cancer. Furthermore, the inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway also showed promising clinical efficacy. In HER2+ breast cancer, dual HER2−targeted therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab is established as the standard treatment. Following the failure of conventional anti-HER2 therapies, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) continues to extend patients’ clinical prognosis through distinct mechanisms of action. For triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), chemotherapy has long been a classic and effective treatment approach. In recent years, advances in translational medicine have expanded treatment options with the introduction of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and anti-Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) ADCs.
