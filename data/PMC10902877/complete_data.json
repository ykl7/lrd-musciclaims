(A) Left and\nmiddle: The dural sheath of a right eye is dissected away from the orbital nerve as well as its insertion into the sclera so as to reveal the optic nerve exit from the posterior scleral canal. The fovea is projected to the posterior scleral surface by passing a 10-prolene suture (shown in blue) on a straight needle (not shown) through the fovea and sclera. Middle: The posterior scleral projection of the fovea is visually projected along the posterior scleral surface (green dotted line) to the temporal (T) midline of the orbital optic nerve and is then extended along the nerve by a (T) cut followed by two additional superior cuts (also along the full extent of the optic nerve), which are then documented on the 3-mm ON stump face (right). (B) Stump-face images for the control and EG eye in OD clinical configuration with the temporal cut serving as the estimated FoBMO axis. (C) ON axon-stained tissue section images after colocalization to the stump-face images allowing the FoBMO (T) axis to be estimated prior to automated counting (as previously published; see Methods).

Note that for presentation purposes, every SBEMR, regardless of its FoBMO sectoral location within the ONH (Fig. 2), is presented in the same orientation (vitreous up, chiasm down, sclera and peripheral-most axon bundles to the right). Each SBEMR thus samples the peripheral-most axon bundles, the laminar insertion zone of the perineural canal sclera, a portion of the peripheral lamina cribrosa (portions of the laminar beams are present but their transverse connectivity is not apparent in individual SBEMR section images), and the immediate RON. Both the control eye SBEMR (“Bii3”) (top) and the EG eye SBEMR (“Bif11”) (bottom) are from the nasal (N) ONH FoBMO 30° sector (Fig. 2H). Both SBEMRs are 200 × 200 × 50 microns in size (see Table 2 and Methods). The block-face images shown here are in the middle of each SBEMR (note the z-axis location of each). Note that in the control eye SBEMR (top), myelin does not start immediately behind the 4XµCTR transposed PLS. However, an expanded retrolaminar region of absent and/or disrupted myelin is qualitatively present in the EG eye SBEMR (bottom left and right). The yellow dotted line represents the transposed PLS. The red dashed line outlines the most peripheral axon bundle. Dark blue outlines the sclera. The blue asterisks in the left images mark the unmyelinated region of retrolaminar axons in the control (top) and EG (bottom) eye. Note that there are virtually no myelinated axons through the full extent of the retrolaminar peripheral axon bundle in the EG eye SBEMR (bottom). Higher-magnification views (right) are taken from locations in the left images (yellow boxes) that are at similar distances behind the PLS. Green arrowheads on the right show representative myelinated axons that are virtually absent in the EG eye SBEMR (bottom right). See Figure 2 for an explanation of how we estimate the magnitude of EG eye axon loss and disruption (by count, shape, and density) (Table 2), within the FoBMO ONH sector sampled by a given SBEMR comparison. See Figure 5 for an introduction to the x-, y-, and z-axes of each SBEMR and an explanation of our method for tracing structurally intact axons through the SBEMR and identifying their myelin onset point for the purpose of MOD measurement. See Figures 6 to 8 for an explanation of our method for generating the PLS within the 4XµCTR of the vibratome section and its transposition to the SBEMR (yellow dotted lines above). See Figure 9 for an explanation of the SBEMR MOD calculation itself. See Table 1 for acronym definitions where not defined herein.",

Middle: All axons within an x–z axon identification plane (located within the lamina) were digitally identified, and then a subset of 300 axons was randomly chosen (in a manner intended to achieve an equal distribution throughout the x and z extent of the identification plane) for tracing. Bottom: From the subset of 300 targeted axons, each randomly selected axon was 3D traced through its full extent until it either ended within the block (nonintact) or left the block (intact). For each intact axon, the myelination onset point was marked, when present. Intact axons without myelin were labeled “unmyelinated.” Individual axons were traced within each SBEMR until approximately 50 structurally intact myelin onset axons were identified. All axon tracing was done without operator awareness of the position of the PLS within the SBEMR.

The PLS segmentations within the SBEMR block-face images on the bottom are facet point depictions of the 4XµCTR fitted PLS surface after it has been colocalized into the SBEMR using the fiducial points shown in Figure 7. Close inspection of the PLS surface at both the top and bottom locations of each volume demonstrates the PLS position to be similar relative to laminar, vascular, and scleral anatomic landmarks common to both volumes.",
