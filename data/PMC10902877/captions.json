The first 10 subsections of the Methods section are organized relative to the 10 subgroups (white numbers) of this schematic. Red outlined boxes refer to animals and initial tissue processing through RON axon counting (hereafter axon counting). Yellow boxes refer to steps that focus on the 4XµCT digital reconstruction (4XµCTR) of a target vibratome tissue section. Green boxes refer to steps that occur within the SBEMR that is obtained from the peripheral ONH neural canal region of a target vibratome section.",
  "figure_2": "Post-mortem tissue processing part 1: estimated FoBMO optic nerve cuts and orbital optic nerve tissue processing for later axon count, density, and size calculations within each study eye. (A) Left and\nmiddle: The dural sheath of a right eye is dissected away from the orbital nerve as well as its insertion into the sclera so as to reveal the optic nerve exit from the posterior scleral canal. The fovea is projected to the posterior scleral surface by passing a 10-prolene suture (shown in blue) on a straight needle (not shown) through the fovea and sclera. Middle: The posterior scleral projection of the fovea is visually projected along the posterior scleral surface (green dotted line) to the temporal (T) midline of the orbital optic nerve and is then extended along the nerve by a (T) cut followed by two additional superior cuts (also along the full extent of the optic nerve), which are then documented on the 3-mm ON stump face (right). (B) Stump-face images for the control and EG eye in OD clinical configuration with the temporal cut serving as the estimated FoBMO axis. (C) ON axon-stained tissue section images after colocalization to the stump-face images allowing the FoBMO (T) axis to be estimated prior to automated counting (as previously published; see Methods). (D) Cylinderization of each axon within their respective axon centroid image allows EG versus control comparisons to occur in eyes in which the EG and control eye ON sections are of different size and shape. See Methods for additional details.

  "figure_4": "Representative SBEMR block-face images from the control eye (top) versus EG eye (bottom) SBEMRs that constitute SBEMR comparison 2 (Table 2). Note that for presentation purposes, every SBEMR, regardless of its FoBMO sectoral location within the ONH (Fig. 2), is presented in the same orientation (vitreous up, chiasm down, sclera and peripheral-most axon bundles to the right). Each SBEMR thus samples the peripheral-most axon bundles, the laminar insertion zone of the perineural canal sclera, a portion of the peripheral lamina cribrosa (portions of the laminar beams are present but their transverse connectivity is not apparent in individual SBEMR section images), and the immediate RON. Both the control eye SBEMR (“Bii3”) (top) and the EG eye SBEMR (“Bif11”) (bottom) are from the nasal (N) ONH FoBMO 30° sector (Fig. 2H). Both SBEMRs are 200 × 200 × 50 microns in size (see Table 2 and Methods). The block-face images shown here are in the middle of each SBEMR (note the z-axis location of each). Note that in the control eye SBEMR (top), myelin does not start immediately behind the 4XµCTR transposed PLS. However, an expanded retrolaminar region of absent and/or disrupted myelin is qualitatively present in the EG eye SBEMR (bottom left and right). The yellow dotted line represents the transposed PLS. The red dashed line outlines the most peripheral axon bundle. Dark blue outlines the sclera. The blue asterisks in the left images mark the unmyelinated region of retrolaminar axons in the control (top) and EG (bottom) eye. Note that there are virtually no myelinated axons through the full extent of the retrolaminar peripheral axon bundle in the EG eye SBEMR (bottom). Higher-magnification views (right) are taken from locations in the left images (yellow boxes) that are at similar distances behind the PLS. Green arrowheads on the right show representative myelinated axons that are virtually absent in the EG eye SBEMR (bottom right). See Figure 2 for an explanation of how we estimate the magnitude of EG eye axon loss and disruption (by count, shape, and density) (Table 2), within the FoBMO ONH sector sampled by a given SBEMR comparison. See Figure 5 for an introduction to the x-, y-, and z-axes of each SBEMR and an explanation of our method for tracing structurally intact axons through the SBEMR and identifying their myelin onset point for the purpose of MOD measurement. See Figures 6 to 8 for an explanation of our method for generating the PLS within the 4XµCTR of the vibratome section and its transposition to the SBEMR (yellow dotted lines above). See Figure 9 for an explanation of the SBEMR MOD calculation itself. See Table 1 for acronym definitions where not defined herein.",
  "figure_5": "Traced, structurally intact axons (blue) within a representative SBEMR (NHP2-EG-Big4 [TI]) with myelin (red) where present relative to the SBEMR PLS. Top: Higher-magnification views are shown of the axons within the red rectangle in the middle. Middle: All axons within an x–z axon identification plane (located within the lamina) were digitally identified, and then a subset of 300 axons was randomly chosen (in a manner intended to achieve an equal distribution throughout the x and z extent of the identification plane) for tracing. Bottom: From the subset of 300 targeted axons, each randomly selected axon was 3D traced through its full extent until it either ended within the block (nonintact) or left the block (intact). For each intact axon, the myelination onset point was marked, when present. Intact axons without myelin were labeled “unmyelinated.” Individual axons were traced within each SBEMR until approximately 50 structurally intact myelin onset axons were identified. All axon tracing was done without operator awareness of the position of the PLS within the SBEMR. The “Traced Axon,” “Axon Myelination,” and “Posterior Laminar Surface” panels are a view of the traced axons through the “front” of the SBEMR shown against the z = 1 (bottom of the SBEMR) block-face image for context. The “Left Side View” (far\nleft) shows the traced axons (without PLS) from the left side of the SBEMR. The “Right Side View” (far\nright) shows the traced axons and the PLS (yellow) from the right side of the SBEMR. See Figure 9 for additional details. See Table 1 for undefined acronym definitions.",

Vessels that can be identified in both volumes are then traced through their full extent in both the 4XµCTR and SBEMR volumes. Right: Segmented vessels from both the 4XµCTR (upper) and SBEMR (lower) volumes are viewed simultaneously to identify common branch points that can be used as fiducial points for colocalization (see Methods).",

The PLS segmentations within the SBEMR block-face images on the bottom are facet point depictions of the 4XµCTR fitted PLS surface after it has been colocalized into the SBEMR using the fiducial points shown in Figure 7. Close inspection of the PLS surface at both the top and bottom locations of each volume demonstrates the PLS position to be similar relative to laminar, vascular, and scleral anatomic landmarks common to both volumes.",
  "figure_9": "MOD calculations relative to the transposed 4XµCTR PLS within the NHP2 Big4 EG (TI) SBEMR shown in Figure 5. Blue denotes the unmyelinated portion of each traced axon. Red denotes the myelinated portion of each traced axon where present. Yellow denotes the transposed 4XµCTR PLS (see Figs. 7 and 8). White\nnumbers denote traced axons that are myelinated within the SBEMR. Green\nnumbers denote traced axons that exit the SBEMR without myelin. For each traced axon that crosses the PLS, if a myelin onset point is identified, MOD is defined to be the linear distance along the traced axon “spline” from its intersection with the PLS. For those axons with a myelin onset point “below” (i.e., “chiasmal to”) the PLS, the MOD value is defined to be (+) in sign. For those axons with a myelin onset point “above” (i.e., “vitreal to”) the PLS, the MOD value is defined to be (–) in sign. For each traced axon that crosses the PLS and exits the block without the identifiable onset of myelin, the MOD is estimated (for “survival” analysis purposes) by the linear distance along the traced axon from its exit point to the PLS. Traced axons that exit the block above the PLS are not included in the analysis.",

While the proportion of unmyelinated axons at each retrolaminar myelin distance is significantly higher for the EG (green) versus its control (red) eye SBEMR for all three comparisons, the magnitude of the difference is smallest for comparison 3 (NHP2 Big4 EG versus Bii5 control). As such, the reproducibility study used the two comparison 3 SBEMRs to assess the ability to consistently detect a significant MOD increase within the EG versus control eye SBEMR, using independent versions of each method step (see Methods and Fig. 13).",

An independent (and masked; see Methods) PLS (yellow) (Figs. 7 and 8) and 4µCTR/SBEMR colocalization (Figs. 9 and 10) was performed for each of the three study versions (Original, Repro1, and Repro2) by the same operator—separated by at least 1 month. Details for each survival curve are shown for the Repro1 version (middle right). While the relative tilt of the PLS varies to some degree within each SBEMR among the three versions, this does not prevent the detection of increased MODs in the Big4 (EG) versus Bii5 (control) eye SBEMRs in the Original.
