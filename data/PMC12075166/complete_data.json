This figure outlines glioma pathophysiology, traditional treatments, and emerging therapies. The p53 pathway’s dysregulation, influenced by phosphorylation, is key in glioma progression. Traditional treatments, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, face resistance and side effects. New approaches, like PD-1 inhibitors and immunotherapy, are being explored. Proton therapy offers more precise targeting of tumors, sparing healthy tissues. Rehabilitation technologies like home training and digital monitoring improve patient autonomy and compliance.",

This figure shows how physical exercise influences glioma progression through systemic and intracellular pathways. Exercise releases factors like FNDC5, Irisin, IGF-1, and adiponectin from adipose tissue and the liver, which cross the blood-brain barrier and regulate glioma cells. These factors activate pathways that enhance mitochondrial function, reduce inflammation, and regulate glioma signaling. Exercise activates p38MAPK, inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines. IGF-1 and adiponectin activate survival pathways like PI3K/AKT, ERK, and GSK3β, promoting cellular homeostasis. Leptin also regulates glioma progression through the PI3K/JAK2/STAT3 axis. These adaptations suggest exercise therapy could complement glioma treatment.",

This figure shows experimental and clinical evidence supporting exercise as a beneficial addition to glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. Exercise enhances quality of life, mental health, and treatment efficacy by modulating biological pathways, reducing drug toxicity, and increasing sensitivity to therapies targeting the MDM2-p53 axis. It affects molecular pathways like Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, and oxidative stress regulation, aiding cellular protection and tumor suppression. Exercise can reduce cancer-related fatigue, offer long-term benefits, and improve prognosis. Prognostic markers like SUMO and ESRLS suggest exercise may improve survival outcomes.

This figure summarizes the existing challenges, research status, and future perspectives of exercise therapy as an adjunctive treatment for gliomas. The current situation and deficiencies highlight the need to refine exercise-based interventions for cancer care. The research status section outlines key limitations, including small sample sizes, heterogeneity, lack of stratification between GBM and other glioma cancers (OGC), and the necessity for intervention for side effects. The future study section emphasizes the need to optimize exercise modes, implement synergistic therapy, and utilize cyclic resistance training, with a focus on personalized treatment schemes. The future outlook discusses the potential of clinical trials, synergistic effects of exercise and therapy, and development of optimized personality schemes for patient-centered care. The personalized design section highlights the importance of tailoring exercise regimens based on tumor type and patient condition, incorporating home tele-coaching, and applying biomarkers to improve the treatment efficacy. Furthermore, exercise therapy is linked to interdisciplinary cooperation and therapeutic synthesis, advocating integrated strategies that enhance patient outcomes and mitigate treatment-related side effects. This framework underscores the necessity for continued research and clinical application of exercise-based interventions for glioma management.",
