  "figure_2": "(a) Schematic of potential mechanisms for glucose restriction induced BTIC enrichment shows the potential for low glucose to select for surviving BTICs or for non-BTICs to adapt to nutrient restriction through acquisition of BTIC-like phenotypes. (b) Strategy for competition experiments with fluorescently labeled BTICs and non-BTICs. (c) Fluorescently labeled BTICs and non-BTICs were plated at defined numbers via flow cytometry and the percentage of cells derived from them monitored over time in standard (4.5 g/L) or restricted glucose (0.45 g/L). Scale bars represent 75 μm. Representative images of cells after 7 days are shown. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the percentage of BTIC and non-BTIC cells from (d) 4121 [*, p=0.0211 with unpaired t-test], (e) IN528 [*, p<0.02 with unpaired t-test], or (f) IN326 [*, p<0.0005 with unpaired t-test] specimens in standard and low glucose and the relative change in the percentage of BTIC-derived cells is shown. Ethidium homodimer III staining demonstrated elevated cell death in non-BTICs derived from (g) M12 [*, p=0.0011 with unpaired t-test] or (h) M43 [*, p<0.001 with unpaired t-test] GBMs after nutrient restriction. In vitro limiting dilution assays in which non-BTICs from (i) IN528 [p=0.014 with ELDA analysis] or (j) M12 [p=0.000045 with ELDA analysis] were plated directly into normal or low glucose demonstrated adaptation to nutrient restriction through promotion of a BTIC phenotype. (k-m) Time lapse imaging using reporter cells in which the Nanog promoter is driving GFP demonstrated that Nanog/GFP- cells can begin expressing Nanog/GFP after 60 hours of nutrient restriction. Three different panels of time lapse images for individual cells which became GFP+ are shown. Scale bars represent 25 μm.",
  "figure_3": "(a) Glucose oxidase assays demonstrate elevated levels of glucose in the lysate of BTICs in comparison to matched non-BTICs [*, p<0.05 with unpaired t-test]. (b) Flow cytometry demonstrates uptake of a fluorescent glucose analogue is higher in CD133 expressing glioma cells [*, p<0.001 with unpaired t-test]. (c) Diagram of the experimental procedure for ex-vivo imaging of glucose uptake in brain slices. CD133-sorted BTICs or non-BTICs were labeled for 45 minutes with CellTracker Red CMPTX or CellTrace FarRed DDAO-SE, respectively. Cells were then engrafted onto live mouse brain slice cultures and allowed to engraft overnight. The next day, the slice culture with engrafted cells was incubated for 30 minutes in 50ug/ml 2-NBDG and imaged via multiphoton microscopy. (d-g) Reconstructions of representative fields, showing increased glucose (green) uptake in BTICs (red). Non-BTICs (cyan) consistently displayed less glucose uptake than BTICs. Scale bars represent 10 μm for d and 15 μm for e-g for the window of the 3D reconstruction.",
  "figure_5": "shRNA directed against Glut3 (shRNA1 and shRNA2) decreases the growth of (a) 3832 [*, p<0.05 with ANOVA] and (b) IN528 [*, p<0.001 with ANOVA] BTICs in comparison to a non-targeting control shRNA as measured using the cell-titer assay. In vitro limiting dilution assays demonstrate that knockdown of Glut3 in BTIC enriched cultures decreases the frequency of (c) 4121 [p=5×10−14 with ELDA analysis] or (d) 3832 [p=5.8×10−11 with ELDA analysis] BTICs. (e) In vivo tumor propagation assays with classical subtype 4121 derived BTICs demonstrate that targeting of Glut3 using shRNA increases the survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts relative to the non-targeting shRNA control. [n=5 for all groups; * p<0.03 with log-rank analysis]. (f) In vivo tumor propagation assays with proneural subtype IN528 derived BTICs demonstrate that targeting of Glut3 using shRNA increases the survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts relative to the non-targeting shRNA control [n=8 for non-targeting control, n=10 for Glut3 shRNA1 and Glut3 shRNA2 groups; * p<0.0004 with log-rank analysis]. (g) In vivo tumor propagation assays with classical subtype M43 derived BTICs demonstrate that targeting of Glut3 using shRNA increases the survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts relative to the non-targeting shRNA control [n=10 for all groups; * p=0.000005 with log-rank analysis].
