  "figure_2": "Procedure for Experiments 1 and 3. An x-shaped fixation guide appeared at the center of the monitor, with a 1° white fixation target placed on top. The fixation guide provided feedback, with green representing fixation within a 1°–2° window, and red noting that the fixation error was greater than this boundary. A red fixation guide paused the trials and reset the fixation timer. After ∼550 ms (± 30 ms) of proper fixation, a Gabor patch briefly appeared at 5° to the left or right, and participants had up to 2 s to respond by making a saccade (Experiment 1) to the target or by pressing the left or right arrow key specifying the side of target appearance (Experiment 3) as quickly and accurately as possible, followed by auditory feedback and a 1-s intertrial interval.",
  "figure_3": "Saccadic reaction time as function of contrast threshold unit. The solid symbol is the amblyopic (or nondominant) eye; the open symbol is the nonamblyopic (or dominant) eye.",
  "figure_4": "Reaction time difference (amblyopic or nondominant eye − dominant eye) versus LogMAR difference (amblyopic or nondominant eye − dominant eye). Large symbols are from the current study. Small symbols are from McKee et al. (2016). The solid black square is the normal control mean from McKee et al. (2016); the open gray circle is a neurotypical control observer from the current study, and the unfilled red circle is the nonamblyopic strabismic observer. Solid red and blue circles are individual data for strabismic and anisometropic amblyopes, respectively.",
  "figure_5": "Procedure for Experiment 2. An x-shaped fixation guide appeared at the center of the monitor, with a 1° white fixation target placed on top. The fixation guide provided feedback, with green representing fixation within a 1° window, and red noting that the fixation error was greater than this boundary. A red fixation guide paused the trials and reset the fixation timer. After ∼550 ms (± 30 ms) of proper fixation, one of six potential gap durations occurred. After the gap period, a Gabor patch briefly appeared at 5° to the left or right, and participants had up to 2 s to respond by making a saccade toward the target, followed by auditory feedback and a 1-s intertrial interval.",
  "figure_6": "Saccadic reaction time as function of gap duration. The solid symbol is the amblyopic eye or nondominant eye; the open symbol is the nonamblyopic eye or dominant eye. The lines fit to the data represent a 2-line fit of the form SL = SLgap × (GD/SLover) × GD (for GD< SLover) + n × GD (for GD ≥ SLover), where SL = saccadic reaction time; SLgap is the asymptotic value with a gap; SLover is the saccadic reaction time with overlap, GD is the gap delay, and N is the slope of line 1. Note that the sloping line segments do not appear straight because the overlap condition is plotted at an arbitrary negative delay.",
  "figure_7": "(Top) Mean gap effect in the amblyopic and nonamblyopic eyes. (Bottom) Saccadic reaction time difference between the two eyes (i.e., nondominant − dominant) versus the gap effect difference (i.e., nondominant − dominant). The vertical and horizontal lines represent no interocular difference in gap effect and no interocular difference in saccadic reaction time, respectively. As noted above, subject S5 participated in the Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1.",
  "figure_8": "Manual reaction time as function of contrast (in threshold units). The solid symbol is the amblyopic (or nondominant) eye; the open symbol is the nonamblyopic (or dominant) eye.",
  "figure_9": "Saccadic asymptotic reaction time difference (nondominant or amblyopic − dominant) versus manual asymptotic reaction time difference (nondominant or amblyopic − dominant). The solid gray line is the best fitting linear regression. The dashed line is the unity line.",
  "figure_10": "(Left). Standard deviation as a function of mean reaction time for the asymptotic saccadic and manual reaction times (highest contrast). (Right) The cumulative percentage of trials as a function of saccadic reaction time for each eye of one neurotypical observer (top panel), one anisometropic amblyope (middle panel) and one of the two strabismic observers with long saccadic reaction time (bottom panel). The triangles on the bottom of each graph show the median reaction time and the interquartile range for each cumulative function."
