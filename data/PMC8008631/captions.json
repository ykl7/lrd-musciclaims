Cells were seeded in growth media; 24 h later lapatinib was added and cells were analyzed with CCK8 as detailed in the “Methods” section. The mean values and SD of four independent experiments are shown. For each experiment, data was obtained from quintuplicates. Paired t tests were done between the groups, and the two-tailed p value is depicted (**). In accordance with the lower expression of RANK achieved, sh#3 significantly reduced survival compared to SKLR control cells at 0.063 (p = 0.0097), 0.125 (p = 0.0055), and 0.25 (p = 0.0003) μM of lapatinib. For sh#4, a significant reduction in survival was observed at 0.125 μM of lapatinib (p = 0.014).
