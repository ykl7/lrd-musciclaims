  "figure_1": "Time course of UV-induced responses in the skin and skin cancer\nevolution. UV irradiation instantaneously generates DNA lesions that are\npotentially mutagenic and carcinogenic. To survive UV damage, cells cope with\nthese deleterious lesions by activating a variety of signaling pathways\nincluding ATR (DNA damage response). UV also generates reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) that promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. Translesion synthesis\nenables DNA synthesis in the presence of UV-induced DNA lesions but may\nincorporate mutations. In the days and weeks following UV exposure, the skin\nexhibits tissue-level responses such as erythema, tanning, angiogenesis,\nepidermal hyperplasia, and immunosuppression. Chronic UV exposure leads to\naccumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. As a result, aberrant cell\nsignaling drives transformation of normal skin cells to premalignant lesions\n(e.g., actinic keratosis (AK) or benign melanocytic nevi). With further increase\nin the burden of genetic and epigenetic alterations, cells may evolve into\ninvasive and metastatic skin cancer. Chronic UV irradiation also promotes\npremature skin aging (photoaging), characterized by wrinkle formation and\nreduced elasticity.",
  "figure_2": "UV-induced DNA lesion formation affected by nucleotide positioning in\nnucleosome. Within an individual nucleosome, due to the rotation of nucleotides\nwithin the DNA double helix, nucleotides are periodically positioned close to\n(‘inner’) or far from (‘outer’) the histone core every ~10 bp. Compared to the\n‘outer’ positions, nucleotides at the ‘inner’ positions have constrained\nflexibility. Thus, UV induces dimer formation more frequently at ‘outer’\ndipyrimidines where DNA bending is more flexible.",
  "figure_3": "UV-induced DNA damage responses to maintain genome integrity. (A) ATR\nactivation by replication blockage. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase\nstalls at UV-induced DNA lesions while MCM helicase continues to unwind duplex\nDNA. This uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities generates a long\nstretch of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is rapidly coated with RPA.\nRPA-coated ssDNA recruits the ATR-ATRIP complex, TopBP1, RHINO, and ETAA1,\nresulting in ATR activation. ATR phosphorylates many downstream targets to\ninduce cell cycle arrest, inhibit DNA replication origin firing, and prevent\nreplication fork collapse. (B) ATM activation by transcription blockage. In\nnoncycling cells, UV-induced DNA lesions stall transcription and displace\nspliceosomes. This leads to hybridization of pre-mRNA with the template DNA\nstrand, leaving the nontemplate strand as ssDNA and forming an R-loop structure\nthat recruits ATM. Subsequently, ATM induces alternative splicing of pre-mRNA,\nleading to altered gene expression in UV-irradiated cells. (C) Nucleotide\nexcision repair (NER) for UV-induced DNA lesions. NER consists of global genome\nrepair (GGR), which recognizes lesions throughout the genome independently of\ntranscription or replication, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which\nrecognizes DNA lesions on transcribed strands of active genes during\ntranscription. In both GGR and TCR, the damaged DNA strand is cleaved at both\nsides of the DNA lesion, generating a lesion-containing product (~30 nt). The\nresulting ssDNA gap is filled by DNA polymerases δ/ε. (D) EXO1-mediated ATR\nactivation and response to excessive lesions. In noncycling cells, EXO1 competes\nwith NER and extends the NER-generated ssDNA gap, making it long enough to\nactivate the DNA damage checkpoint. Compared to low doses, high doses of UV\nirradiation generate lesions more frequently, and thus there is a greater chance\nthat two DNA lesions are closely positioned on opposing strands (closely\nopposing lesions, COLs). One lesion is removed by NER, but the other lesion\nremains in the resulting ssDNA gap. NER gap filling by DNA polymerases δ/ε\nstalls at this lesion, and EXO1 extends the ssDNA gap. Translesion synthesis\n(TLS) polymerases fill the lesion-containing gap and displace EXO1. If TLS\npolymerases are deficient, EXO1 will continue to extend the ssDNA gap, leading\nto double-strand breaks and cell death. (E) Translesion synthesis (TLS) as DNA\ndamage tolerance. When cells enter S phase with UV-induced DNA lesions,\nreplicative DNA polymerases stall at the lesion. To resume DNA replication,\nrepriming occurs downstream of the lesion. The resulting ssDNA gap will be\nfilled by TLS polymerases that can synthesize DNA across the lesion but may\nincorporate mutations. TLS occurs in an error-free or error-prone manner.",
  "figure_4": "Cell cycle checkpoints elicited by UV-induced ATR activation.\nG1-S checkpoint: Following\nUV-induced DNA damage in G1 phase, activated ATR phosphorylates p53\nat Ser15 and CHK1 at Ser345. Phospho-CHK1 inactivates CDC25A, preventing\ndephosphorylation of CDK2 and inducing G1 arrest. The p53-p21 pathway\nalso inhibits CDK2. Intra-S checkpoint: UV activates the ATR-CHK1\npathway in S phase, decreasing the function of CDK. DNA replication origin\nfiring requires phosphorylation of Treslin by CDK, and thus it is plausible that\nreplication stress prevents origin firing via inhibiting Treslin\nphosphorylation. S-G2\ncheckpoint: ATR senses ongoing DNA replication during unperturbed S\nphase, inhibiting CDK1 activity and preventing cell cycle progression to\nG2 phase. When DNA replication is completed, ATR activity is\ndiminished, allowing CDK1 to phosphorylate FOXM1 for S-G2 transition.\nG2-M checkpoint:\nUV-induced ATR-CHK1 activation inhibits CDC25C and CDK1 activities, preventing\nG2-M transition. WEE1 phosphorylates and inhibits CDK1, also\ninducing G2 arrest.",
  "figure_5": "Repair of UV-induced DNA lesions depends on chromatin state and sliding\nof nucleotide positions. (A) UV irradiation forms dimers at dipyrimidine sites\non the same strand, distorting the DNA double helix. The two major types of DNA\nlesions are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts (6–4PPs),\nwhich differ in terms of their abundance, degree of DNA distortion, and the\nprimary mode of repair (global genome repair (GGR) or transcription-coupled\nrepair (TCR)). Chromatin state influences formation and repair of UV-induced DNA\nlesion; lesions form more frequently and are repaired more slowly in\nheterochromatin than in euchromatin. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)\nhave variable frequency of lesion formation and slow lesion repair that leads to\nhigh mutation rate. The structures of DNA double helix with CPD and 6–4PP\nlesions are adapted with permission from Rastogi, R. P. et al. J Nucleic\nAcids (2010) 2010:592980. (B) UV-induced DNA lesions that are\noccluded within a nucleosome undergo ‘slide-assisted site exposure’: slight\nsliding of nucleotide positions relative to the histone core, without affecting\nthe overall nucleosome architecture. This process transiently exposes occluded\nlesions to UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB), which recognizes UV damage\nand initiates global genome repair (GGR).",
  "figure_6": "Chemical structures of UV-induced DNA lesions and mechanisms of\nUV-induced mutagenesis. (A) Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and 6–4\nphotoproduct (6–4PP) lesions are UV-induced dimers formed at dipyrimidine sites,\ne.g., two adjacent thymines (TpT). CPDs are generated by UV from simulated\nsunlight 6 times more frequently than 6–4PPs. (B) Oxidative stress can be\ninduced by UVA rather than UVB and damages 2’-deoxyguanosine, converting it into\nthe DNA lesion 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG). (C) Cytosine and\n5-methylcytosine (5-mC) can be deaminated into uracil and thymine, respectively.\nDeamination occurs more frequently when cytosine or 5-mC is part of a CPD on a\ntranscribed strand. (D) UVA and UVB compose 95% and 5% of UV radiation from\nterrestrial sunlight, respectively. UVA and UVB irradiation generate 8-OH-dG,\nCPD, and 6–4PP DNA lesions. Deamination may occur at CPDs. During the first\nround of DNA replication after lesion formation, correct or incorrect\nnucleotides are incorporated opposite of the lesion via different mechanisms\nincluding misincorporation and error-free and error-prone translesion synthesis\n(TLS). During the second round of DNA replication, complementary nucleotides are\nincorporated opposite of the correct or incorrect nucleotides that were from the\nfirst round. This results in mutation fixation. Due to the abundance and slow\nrepair of CPDs, the resulting C>T mutations are the most prevalent UV-induced\nmutations and are known as UV signature mutations. Thickness of each arrow\nleading from UVA and UVB to DNA lesion types in the panel indicates the relative\ncontributions of UVA and UVB to formation of each lesion type.",
  "figure_7": "Targeting UV-induced signaling pathways to suppress skin carcinogenesis.\nUV-induced DNA lesions stall DNA replication forks and activate the ATR pathway.\nThe ATR pathway maintains genome integrity, allowing cells to survive UV-induced\nDNA damage but possibly with unrepaired lesions that become mutations\n(‘mutagenic survival’). Thus, chronic UV exposure will increase mutation burden,\naccumulating cancer driver mutations that may promote skin cancer development.\nUV-induced p53 upregulates XPC, which facilitates DNA repair and prevents\nmetabolic alterations that drive cancer. UV-induced reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) activate the EGFR and p38 MAPK pathways, contributing to skin cancer\ndevelopment. HMGB1 released from UV-damaged keratinocytes activates the TLR4\npathway, which can drive skin cancer via inflammation and immunosuppression.\nInhibiting ATR (via caffeine), ROS (via the tea polyphenol EGCG), or TLR4 (via\nresatorvid) has been demonstrated to prevent UV-induced skin carcinogenesis\nin vivo.",
  "figure_8": "Targeting the ATR pathway to prevent cancer development. (A) ATR\ninhibition prevents UV-induced skin cancer development. After UV exposure, ATR\ninduces cell cycle arrest that allows time for DNA repair, resulting in limited\napoptosis. However, when DNA replication is ongoing before completion of DNA\nrepair, mutations may be incorporated via DNA damage tolerance mechanisms\n(‘mutagenic survival’), leading to skin cancer development. In contrast,\ninhibition of the ATR pathway that is essential for surviving UV damage leads to\naugmented apoptosis. This contributes to elimination of DNA-damaged cells that\nare at increased risk of malignant transformation, thereby inhibiting skin\ncancer development. (B) ATR inhibition sensitizes p53-defective cells to\nDNA-damaging agents. Normal cells have two major pathways that respond to DNA\ndamage: the ATM-CHK2-p53 and ATR-CHK1 pathways, which induce cell cycle arrest\nand DNA repair. However, precancerous cells are often defective in p53 and thus\nrely on the ATR-CHK1 pathway to survive DNA damage. When p53-defective\nprecancerous cells are treated with an ATR inhibitor in the presence of a\nDNA-damaging agent (e.g., UV or chemotherapeutic drug), these cells will have no\nintact DNA damage response pathway to survive the DNA damage (synthetic\nlethality of defective p53 and ATR inhibition). As a result, precancerous cells\nwill undergo apoptosis, and cancer development will be suppressed. This\nsynthetic lethality provides the molecular basis for the use of ATR inhibitors\nto prevent cancer development from p53-defective cells.",
  "figure_9": "Targeting oncogenic MAPK and PI3K pathways in skin cancer. Receptor\ntyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate the mitogen-activated protein\nkinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and the\nphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which are frequently aberrant in skin\ncancer. MAPK/ERK phosphorylates transcription factors and upregulates expression\nof genes important for cell proliferation and survival. The mammalian target of\nrapamycin (mTOR) upregulates mRNA translation of these genes. Aberrant\nactivation of these pathways (e.g., activating\nBRAFV600E mutation) leads to increased\nproliferation and survival. RAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, sorafenib, and\ndabrafenib, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib are currently used in melanoma\ntreatment. However, RAF inhibitor monotherapy for melanoma can accelerate the\nprogression of preexisting RAS-mutant skin lesions into\ncutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Combination therapy with dabrafenib\nand trametinib, each targeting a different kinase within the MAPK pathway,\nreduces the incidence of cSCC in melanoma patients treated with a RAF\ninhibitor.",
  "figure_10": "Mechanism of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer. The prodrug\n5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is preferentially distributed to tumor tissue in a\npatient. Tumor cells metabolize 5-ALA into the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX\n(PpIX). Subsequently, target cells are exposed to visible light (either 400 nm\nor 635 nm) that is absorbed by PpIX. Excited PpIX generates reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) that lead to tumor cell death, anticancer immune response, and\ndestruction of tumor vasculature. Visible light illumination and the prodrug\n5-ALA have limited penetration into deeper tumor tissue, reducing the efficacy\nof PDT for larger tumors."
