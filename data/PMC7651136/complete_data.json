      "caption": "Time course of UV-induced responses in the skin and skin cancer\nevolution. UV irradiation instantaneously generates DNA lesions that are\npotentially mutagenic and carcinogenic. To survive UV damage, cells cope with\nthese deleterious lesions by activating a variety of signaling pathways\nincluding ATR (DNA damage response). UV also generates reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) that promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. Translesion synthesis\nenables DNA synthesis in the presence of UV-induced DNA lesions but may\nincorporate mutations. In the days and weeks following UV exposure, the skin\nexhibits tissue-level responses such as erythema, tanning, angiogenesis,\nepidermal hyperplasia, and immunosuppression. Chronic UV exposure leads to\naccumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. As a result, aberrant cell\nsignaling drives transformation of normal skin cells to premalignant lesions\n(e.g., actinic keratosis (AK) or benign melanocytic nevi). With further increase\nin the burden of genetic and epigenetic alterations, cells may evolve into\ninvasive and metastatic skin cancer. Chronic UV irradiation also promotes\npremature skin aging (photoaging), characterized by wrinkle formation and\nreduced elasticity.",

During DNA replication, DNA polymerase\nstalls at UV-induced DNA lesions while MCM helicase continues to unwind duplex\nDNA. This uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities generates a long\nstretch of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is rapidly coated with RPA.\nRPA-coated ssDNA recruits the ATR-ATRIP complex, TopBP1, RHINO, and ETAA1,\nresulting in ATR activation. ATR phosphorylates many downstream targets to\ninduce cell cycle arrest, inhibit DNA replication origin firing, and prevent\nreplication fork collapse. (B) ATM activation by transcription blockage. In\nnoncycling cells, UV-induced DNA lesions stall transcription and displace\nspliceosomes. This leads to hybridization of pre-mRNA with the template DNA\nstrand, leaving the nontemplate strand as ssDNA and forming an R-loop structure\nthat recruits ATM. Subsequently, ATM induces alternative splicing of pre-mRNA,\nleading to altered gene expression in UV-irradiated cells. (C) Nucleotide\nexcision repair (NER) for UV-induced DNA lesions. NER consists of global genome\nrepair (GGR), which recognizes lesions throughout the genome independently of\ntranscription or replication, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which\nrecognizes DNA lesions on transcribed strands of active genes during\ntranscription. In both GGR and TCR, the damaged DNA strand is cleaved at both\nsides of the DNA lesion, generating a lesion-containing product (~30 nt). The\nresulting ssDNA gap is filled by DNA polymerases δ/ε. (D) EXO1-mediated ATR\nactivation and response to excessive lesions. In noncycling cells, EXO1 competes\nwith NER and extends the NER-generated ssDNA gap, making it long enough to\nactivate the DNA damage checkpoint. Compared to low doses, high doses of UV\nirradiation generate lesions more frequently, and thus there is a greater chance\nthat two DNA lesions are closely positioned on opposing strands (closely\nopposing lesions, COLs). One lesion is removed by NER, but the other lesion\nremains in the resulting ssDNA gap. NER gap filling by DNA polymerases δ/ε\nstalls at this lesion, and EXO1 extends the ssDNA gap. Translesion synthesis\n(TLS) polymerases fill the lesion-containing gap and displace EXO1. If TLS\npolymerases are deficient, EXO1 will continue to extend the ssDNA gap, leading\nto double-strand breaks and cell death. (E) Translesion synthesis (TLS) as DNA\ndamage tolerance. When cells enter S phase with UV-induced DNA lesions,\nreplicative DNA polymerases stall at the lesion. To resume DNA replication,\nrepriming occurs downstream of the lesion. The resulting ssDNA gap will be\nfilled by TLS polymerases that can synthesize DNA across the lesion but may\nincorporate mutations. TLS occurs in an error-free or error-prone manner.",

Receptor\ntyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate the mitogen-activated protein\nkinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and the\nphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which are frequently aberrant in skin\ncancer. MAPK/ERK phosphorylates transcription factors and upregulates expression\nof genes important for cell proliferation and survival. The mammalian target of\nrapamycin (mTOR) upregulates mRNA translation of these genes. Aberrant\nactivation of these pathways (e.g., activating\nBRAFV600E mutation) leads to increased\nproliferation and survival. RAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, sorafenib, and\ndabrafenib, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib are currently used in melanoma\ntreatment. However, RAF inhibitor monotherapy for melanoma can accelerate the\nprogression of preexisting RAS-mutant skin lesions into\ncutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Combination therapy with dabrafenib\nand trametinib, each targeting a different kinase within the MAPK pathway,\nreduces the incidence of cSCC in melanoma patients treated with a RAF\ninhibitor.",
