B, Schematic overview of the systemic and local pathophysiologic alterations in HGGs relevant to cfDNA fragmentation and liquid biopsies. HGGs establish a systemic and local immune-suppressive environment that leads to systemic lymphopenia and infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Apoptotic lymphocytes release cfDNA in the circulation, increasing the contribution of lymphocytes to the total pool of cfDNA fragments compared with individuals without cancer. In the local microenvironment, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is broken down in the tumor, thus allowing nucleosomal DNA from apoptotic tumor cells and other supporting cells to exit into the circulation.",

ARTEMIS–DELFI score distribution across noncancer individuals and patients with brain tumor, stratified by grade and histology, in the discovery cohort. A, The boxplot shows the median ARTEMIS–DELFI score and the IQR with the individual sample values overlaid as dots. The noncancer neurologic controls, although overall exhibiting low ARTEMIS–DELFI scores, have a higher score than the screening population group (median score of 0.25 vs. 0.11; P < 0.0001). The noncancer cases with or without neurologic conditions have a lower ARTEMIS–DELFI score compared with brain tumor cases, and there is an incremental increase in the ARTEMIS–DELFI score between the LGGs (median score of 0.46) and HGGs (median score of 0.71). Within primary brain tumors, the highest median DELFI score is observed in GBMs (median score 0.72). Metastatic brain tumors (including lung, breast, ovarian, melanoma, and kidney cancers) have a high score (median of 0.86).
