  "figure_1": "The horizontal line indicates phenome-wide significance. Phenome-wide significant traits are indicated by PheCodes with their description listed below. Directional triangles indicate whether a phenome-wide significant trait was positively (pointing up) or negatively (pointing down) associated with the PRS.",
  "figure_2": "Reported risk SNPs within 1 Mb were merged into the same locus. Loci that were also reported to be associated with skin tanning ability are highlighted in bold. Loci were named according to the closest RefSeq genes (except M1CR a 385 kb locus with 16 RefSeq genes and HV745896 named after a nearby, uncurated mRNA sequence)."
