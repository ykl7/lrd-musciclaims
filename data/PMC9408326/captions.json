(b) ACBD3 mRNA in breast tumour samples (red) and paired normal breast tissue (green) (*** p = < 0.001, Log2FC cutoff = 0.75). ACBD3 expression was 93.06% higher in cancerous breast tissue and samples also had a larger range of expression than normal tissue. (c) Protein levels of ACBD3 in cancers, measured by medium or high antibody staining as a percentage of total patient samples.",
  "figure_2": "The frequency of ACBD3 genetic alterations in cancers. (a) ACBD3 is mutated infrequently in breast cancers but is amplified more in breast cancer than in any other cancer. ACBD3 is most frequently mutated in adrenocortical carcinoma. (b) Position and frequency of mutations in ACBD3 that result in amino acid changes for all cancers and (c) breast cancers. The ACBP and GOLD domain are highlighted; ACBD3 somatic mutation frequency in breast cancers was 0.5%.",
  "figure_3": "ACBD3 promoter methylation in normal breast tissue (blue) and breast tumor tissue (red). A low beta value represents low methylation and therefore low inhibition of transcription. A beta value below 0.3 is considered hypomethylation. ACBD3 promoter methylation was very low in both normal and tumor breast tissue with no significant difference. Gene regulation by methylation cannot account for changes to ACBD3 expression found in breast cancers.",
  "figure_4": "Receptor, enzyme, and transcription factor pathway nodes, small molecules, and viruses that regulate ACBD3 transcription. Blue dots represent repression of ACBD3 transcripts and red dots represent promotion of ACBD3 transcripts; the cut-off was set at a transcription fold change of at least 2 and a confidence interval of 99.9% or greater. (a) Factors that affect ACBD3 transcription across all normal tissues. (b) Factors that affect ACBD3 transcription in normal breast tissue.",
  "figure_5": "Kaplan–Meier plots for patient prognosis when divided by ACBD3 mRNA expression. Black data points represent patients whose breast tumors had ACBD3 mRNA expression below the median level. Red data points represent patients whose breast tumors had ACBD3 mRNA expression above the median level. (a–d) Relapse-free survival when ACBD3 is high or low for (a) breast cancer patient cohort overall, (b) HER2− breast cancer patients, (c) ER+ breast cancer patients, (d) ER−breast cancer patients. (e,f) Overall survival when tumor ACBD3 is high or low for (e) the breast cancer patient cohort overall, (f) ER+ breast cancer patients.

  "figure_7": "Histology of ACBD3 stained breast cores. (a–d) An invasive carcinoma from a 39-year-old female, stage IIA, ER- PR- HER2 2+ reveals a pattern of differential ACBD3 staining (brown), haematoxylin was used a as a nuclear stain (blue). (a) Low magnification image of entire core, fibrous interlobular tissue has a low level of ACBD3 staining whilst breast duct acini have high levels of ACBD3 staining. (b) Medium magnification of regular and irregular duct acini. (c) High magnification of regular small acini, shows high ACBD3 staining of luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells. (d) High magnification of irregular large acini. Luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells are both highly stained for ACBD3 but cells within the acini, possibly a ductal carcinoma in situ have a moderate-to-low level of ACBD3 staining, with some embedded cells with high levels of ACBD3, possibly luminal epithelial cells. (e–h) Typical ACBD3 staining of different cores. (a) Invasive ductal carcinoma of a 47-year-old female. Stage IA, grade 3, T1N0M0 scored as 1.1 overall for ACBD3 staining. (b) Invasive ductal carcinoma of a 50-year-old female. Stage IIA, Grade 2, T2N0M0 scored as a 2 overall for ACBD3 staining. (c) Normal-adjacent breast tissue with ductal ectasia of a 41-year-old female, scored 2.9 overall. (d) Cancer-adjacent tissue (adenosis) of a 39-year-old female, scored 1.7 overall.",

(a) Array BR1008B, there was no statistical difference in ACBD3 staining between malignant breast tissue (n = 48) and metastatic breast cancer of the lymph node (n = 38). (b) Array BR1008B, ACBD3 protein expression was significantly higher in PR negative breast cancer cores (n = 50) compared to PR 3+ cores (n = 9) (malignant breast tissue and metastatic lymph tissue, * p = 0.02202), but there was no statistical difference between PR− samples compared to all grades of PR+ core (not shown). (c) Array BC08032a, ACBD3 protein levels are significantly lower in malignant tissue compared to either cancer-adjacent tissue or normal-adjacent tissue, *** p < 0.001; ns = not significant (d) Array BR1401, there was a statistically significant difference between HER2− (grade 0) breast cancer samples and HER 1+ samples, * p = 0.0107.
