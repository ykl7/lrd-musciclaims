  "figure_1": "Example of orthogonally oriented Gabor patches used to induce binocular contrast rivalry in this study. Panel (A) shows image pair of equal contrast (100%) in both eyes (baseline) and panel (B) shows image pair with dissimilar contrasts in the two eyes. Each image pair can be cross-fused to experience binocular rivalry with equal and dissimilar contrasts in the two eyes.",
  "figure_2": "Panel (A) shows the contrast rivalry switches between the dominant and nondominant eye of a representative control subject plotted as a function of time at baseline (top panel). Similar rivalry switches between the stronger and weaker eye of a representative keratoconic case at baseline and at the contrast balance point (approximately 20% in the stronger eye and 100% in the weaker eye) is shown in the middle and bottom panels, respectively. Panel (B) shows the percentage of dwell time on the nondominant eye (in controls) or weaker eye (in patients with keratoconus) plotted as a function of the stimulus contrast in the dominant eye (in controls) or stronger eye (in patients with keratoconus). Data of one representative control and three cases with different severities of keratoconus in the weaker eye along with their respective balance points are shown here. The curves represent the spline interpolation functions that were fit to the individual data points to determine the balance point.",
  "figure_3": "Box and whisker plots of the number of perceptual rivalry switches per session panel (A), the dwell time on the dominant eye of controls and stronger eye of cases panel (B) and the dwell time on the nondominant eye of controls and weaker eye of cases panel (C) at baseline and at the balance point (BP). In all three panels, the blue plots indicate data from controls and the red plots indicate data from cases. In each panel, the solid horizontal line within the box indicates the group median, lower and upper edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th interquartile range, lower and upper whiskers indicate the 1st and 99th quartiles and the plus symbols indicate outliers.",
  "figure_4": "Scatter diagram of the contrast balance point of cases and controls plotted against their respective interocular differences in decimal acuity panel (A) and D-index panel (B). The open red symbols indicate outlier data points (see discussion for details).",
  "figure_6": "Scatter diagrams of contrast balance point of cases obtained using low and high-spatial frequency stimuli panel (A) and with spectacle and RGP contact lens correction panel (B). The diagonal line in both panels indicate the 1:1 line of equality.",
  "figure_7": "Percentage contribution of the dominant eye of controls to the binocular rivalry task for varying levels of induced interocular difference in contrast (blue band; bottom abscissa and left ordinate). The blue band shows the ±95% confidence intervals of controls. The actual data points are not shown to avoid clutter. Percentage contribution of the weaker eye of patients with keratoconus to the binocular rivalry task plotted against the corresponding contrast loss experienced at baseline (i.e. 1 – contrast balance point; top abscissa and right ordinate). Data from spectacles and RGP contact lenses are shown as closed and open red circles, respectively. The dashed horizontal line along the 50% ordinate mark indicates equal contribution between the dominant and nondominant eyes of controls and between the stronger and weaker eyes of cases."
