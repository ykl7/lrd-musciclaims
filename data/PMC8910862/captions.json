  "figure_1": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is originated from malignant haematopoietic stem cell and is characterized by abnormal clonal expansion and aberrant differentiation of immature clonal myeloid cells. AML progresses with the acquisition of new genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities in response to chemotherapy and displays substantial heterogeneity.

Overall framework for the identification of targeted therapy through network-based machine learning. Multidisciplinary databases and drug sensitivity testing (in vitro and in vivo) are used as inputs to train the machine learning model.

  "figure_3": "Personalized medicine strategy to tailor treatments for patients with chemotherapy refractory blood cancer. The platform involves (1) in vitro high throughput screening on primary cells from patient samples; (2) deep molecular and genomic profiling of the patients samples; (3) integrating drug sensitivity and sequencing data; (4) optimal drug combination and dosage using experimental-analytic AI platform.
