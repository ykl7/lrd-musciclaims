Input: Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered as inputs into the model; 2. Preprocessing: apply several techniques to remove background, normalize images, patch extraction and data augmentation; Step 3: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) Application: The preprocessed dataset is fed into a DCNN model. The model can be used a feature extractor or classify/predict the outputs, directly; if the DCNN model is applied as a feature extractor, these features can be combined with patients clinical information and make a numerical dataset to apply as inputs of machine learning models to classify/predict the outputs (the architecture is now outdated, but is used because its relevant for cited papers); 4. Model outputs: brain cancer biomarker status prediction, tumor types classification, or survival rate classification/prediction (Pr).",
