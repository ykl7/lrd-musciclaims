  "figure_1": "Study design. A Breast cancer patients and control individuals included in this study originate from 33 different study center countries, and comprise samples of African, Asian, European, or Latin American and Hispanic ancestry. B The mummy implemented extended SKAT-O analysis includes variants located in coding regions with an extended window and variants located in linked regulatory regions. Regulatory regions were identified based on overlap with genetic range of coding features or based on presence of gene-specific eQTLs in GTEx data in those regulatory regions",

A Depiction of coding regions of all coding genes (data retrieved from Ensembl biomart hg38) within the chromosomal region with FMNL3 highlighted in blue. B Variants included in the aggregation test, plotted according to their chromosomal position and analysis weight. Highlighted in blue are variants exclusively present in the analysis of samples of diverse ancestry. C Single-marker association results based on the same samples [10], with blue solid line denoting P-value for meta-analysis of all cohorts for gene of interest (P = 1.24 × 10−5) in this study and blue dashed line denoting unadjusted P-value for all-European meta-analysis (P = 6.11 × 10−6)"
