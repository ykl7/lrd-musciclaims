A Breast cancer patients and control individuals included in this study originate from 33 different study center countries, and comprise samples of African, Asian, European, or Latin American and Hispanic ancestry.

Regulatory regions were identified based on overlap with genetic range of coding features or based on presence of gene-specific eQTLs in GTEx data in those regulatory regions",
