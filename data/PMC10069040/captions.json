High expression of Talin-1 was found in mRNA levels in tumors compared with normal tissues (|Log2FC| Cut-off ≥ 0.5 and P < 0.01) by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2).",
  "figure_2": "Comparison between Talin-1 (TLN1) expression from normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastatic tissues for skin data on UCSC Xena web-based tool. (A) heat map and (B) boxplot showed a high expression levels of Talin-1 in melanoma skin cancer patients with metastases rather than primary tumor tissues (Welch’s t-test, P = 0.008 (t = -2.679))",
  "figure_3": "Immunohistochemical staining of Talin-1 protein expression in skin cancer and normal skin tissues. Talin-1 protein expression in melanoma skin cancer tissues: low expression (A, A-1) and high expression (B, B-1). Talin-1 protein expression in non melanoma skin cancer (NMSCs) tissues low expression (C, C-1), and high expression (D, D-1). IHC staining of skin normal tissue (E), and human normal kidney as (F) positive and (G) negative controls. Figures are shown with a magnification of 100 × and 200×",
  "figure_4": "Kaplan-Meier survival curves for disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) based on Talin-1 cytoplasmic protein expression in skin cancer tissue samples. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no significant differences between DSS (A) or PFS (B) of melanoma skin cancer patients with high or low expression of Talin-1. Likewise, no significant differences were seen between DSS (C) or PFS (D) of non melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) patients with high or low expression of Talin-1. However, shorter DSS durations were seen in melanoma patients with higher levels of Talin-1"
