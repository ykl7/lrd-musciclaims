  "figure_8": "In SCC, exposure to SFN hinders cancer progression and in vivo metastasis by diminishing arginine methylation at histone 3 (H3). This reduction involves SFN-induced proteasomal degradation of arginine N-methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and methylosome protein 50 (MEP50). Both enzymes are responsible for arginine methylation at H3 and H4, respectively, leading to decreased levels of dimethylated arginine 3 at H4 (H4R3me2) [193]. Moreover, using a biotin-tagged SFN analog (Biotin-ITC) and kinetic analysis, it was showed that SFN covalently binds to recombinant type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), irreversibly inhibiting its transamidase activity. This induces an open/extended conformation and partially inhibits GTP binding, which is crucial for maintaining the aggressive SCC phenotype [194].",
