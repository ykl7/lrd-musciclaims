  "figure_1": "Metabolic differences between cancer stem cells and non-stem cancer cells. Increased mitochondrial activity in GBM CSCs results in increased oxidative phosphorylation, leading to elevated oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species that promote genomic alterations and instability that ultimately lead to clonal heterogeneity. Increased fatty acid oxidation is linked to the relative proliferative quiescence of GBM CSCs. Other metabolites, such as the levels of α-ketoglutarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate, promote epigenetic alterations that contribute to stem cell maintenance. By contrast, non-stem cancer cells primarily depend on aerobic glycolysis that results in the Warburg effect and drives increased proliferation in these cells",
  "figure_2": "Therapeutic strategies to target brain tumors’ metabolism. Metabolic targeting in brain tumors can be divided into four major strategies: depletion of extrinsic nutrients from the tumor milieu, blocking the uptake of extrinsic nutrients by tumor cells, inhibiting the biosynthesis of essential endogenous metabolites, or promoting the toxic accumulation of intermediary metabolites",
  "figure_3": "Features of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and recurrence. The composition and regulation of the tumor microenvironment is dependent on multiple interconnected factors including in a non-hierarchical order metabolism, therapies, niches, cell types, (epi)genetic alterations, and additional extrinsic effectors such as nutrients, oxygen (O2), pH, and apoptosis"
