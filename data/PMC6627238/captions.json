  "figure_1": "(A) Schematic of the human breast highlighting terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs), the site of origin in a number of breast cancers. (B) Some of the major risk factors underlying high‐risk status for breast cancer. (C) Schematic of a ductal cross‐section, depicting the progression of breast cancer from normal bi‐layered epithelium to hyperplasia, to hyperplasia with atypia, to ductal carcinoma in situ, and finally to invasive disease.",
  "figure_2": "(A) The murine estrous cycle is shown with mammary whole mounts depicting the gross morphological changes elicited by fluctuations in the ovarian hormones, estrogen, and progesterone. The corresponding expansion in mammary stem and progenitors is also highlighted. Schematic illustrates the strategy of utilizing factors that limit stem/progenitor expansion as chemopreventive agents in breast cancer. Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator, and denosumab is an anti‐RANKL agent. (B) Schematic of key mitogenic paracrine effectors downstream of progesterone in the breast, some of which may prove effective as targets in future breast cancer chemoprevention strategies.",
  "figure_3": "(A) Schematic illustrating the main GO terms biological processes (≥ 3‐fold upregulated, FDR ≤ 0.01) enriched in the three distinct mammary cell subpopulations in response to progesterone, based on proteomic analysis from Casey et al. (B) Visualization of the indicated epigenetic proteins or histone marks (green) in situ. Lineage specificity is observed for select proteins (EZH2, DNMT1, and SETD7). Cytokeratin 5 (red) marks the basal compartment. (C) Comparative abundance of epigenetic regulatory proteins detected in luminal vs. basal compartment.",

FACS‐purified mammary cell populations are the input for integrative molecular profiling, target validation, rationalized drug identification, and evaluation in a series of biological, pre‐clinical assays."
