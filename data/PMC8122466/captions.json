  "figure_1": "Patient derived in vitro models of glioblastoma used in this study. Following surgical resection, the tissue sample is dissected and streamed into two workflows: (′) the generation of two dimensional (2D) culture of low passage patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs); and (″) the culture of three dimensional (3D) patient-derived glioblastoma explant organoids (GBOs). Key steps (3–5) for each workflow are mentioned and the gray-background images correspond to DIC microscopy images.",
  "figure_2": "Potential targets for glioblastoma based on literature review, current clinical management and clinical trials for glioblastoma. Note that there are only 2 (4% of the total number of targets identified in this study) targeted therapies currently approved for glioblastoma treatment in the clinic; 31 targeted therapies (62% of total) for which there is a U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)- approved drug and/or are currently being evaluated in glioma/brain tumors clinical trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov); and 17 (34%) recently identified molecular targets for which there is an available drug either FDA-approved but not listed for glioblastoma or an inhibitor developed but not yet clinically approved for any medical condition.",

  "figure_4": "Drug screening using patient-derived 2D GSC cultures. (A) (i–vii) Heatmaps of each plate representing cell viability results for G18-T cells treated with eight drug concentrations for each drug as well as negative control (StemPro Neural Stem Cell serum-free medium, NSC Medium) and vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) for each plate. The color bar of each heatmap shows bioluminescent units, an index of the number of viable cells. Red indicates low cell viability index and dark blue indicates high cell viability index. (i’–vii’) Dose vs. Response graphs for the test conditions as in (i–vii). Data are mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) for an experiment performed in quadruplicate. (B) Heatmap with hierarchical clustering representing the IC50 of each drug in FPW1 and G18-T cells. Bright red indicates low IC50 and bright blue indicates high IC50.",
  "figure_5": "Resistance to standard of care treatment “in a dish” in 2D cultures of GSC and in GBOs. (A) Brightfield images of primary G18-T (untreated) and Stupp G18-T (temozolomide (TMZ)+radiation treated) 2D cell cultures over the 8-day treatment period. Day 0 images were taken immediately before treatment (Scale bar 300 µm). (B) Cell viability measured at the end of the protocol using CellTiter-Glo® 2.0 bioluminescence assay. (C) Brightfield images of Primary GBOs (untreated) and Stupp GBOs (TMZ+radiation treated) over the 10-day treatment period, with Day 0 images taken immediately before treatment (Scale bar 1 mm). (D) 2D area of GBOs at Day 10 for each treatment condition. All images were processed using ImageJ with consistent settings applied for all images. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4 (B), n = 10 (D); **, p < 0.01; ns, not significant, two tailed, t-test.",
  "figure_6": "Response to second line treatment of treatment naïve and resistant glioblastoma. (A) Primary and Stupp G18-T cell line response to the addition of Vismodegib, Disulfiram, Parthenolide, Omipalisib or Costunolide. Data represent cell viability for each treatment group with the addition of each of the five selected drugs. Data are mean ± SEM for four replicates. All treatment groups were compared with their respective group (primary or Stupp) control (**** p < 0.0001, TWO-WAY ANOVA with Sidak correction for multiple comparisons). (B) GBO response to the addition of selected drugs. Brightfield images of primary GBO (untreated) and Stupp GBO (TMZ+radiation treated) with additional treatment with each selected drug over the 10-day treatment period, with Day 0 images taken before the start of the treatment. Scale bar 0.1 mm. Magnified images of primary and Stupp GBO for Control, Parthenolide and Costunolide treatment are also presented."
