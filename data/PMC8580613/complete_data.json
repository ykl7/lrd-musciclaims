A, A population of patients with suboptimal immunity to SARS-CoV-2, with some persons not vaccinated (pink, both adults and children), some persons with decreased antibody levels after vaccination (light blue), some persons without face masks with different levels of immunity to the virus, a person with COVID-19 (red), and a person with a hematologic malignancy without ability to mount full protection to COVID-19 despite vaccination (purple, in the center). In this setting, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can make its way from the infected person to the vulnerable patient with a hematologic malignancy without seroconversion after full COVID-19 vaccination. B, An alternate scenario, where all caregivers and health care workers taking care of a patient with hematologic malignancy are fully immune to COVID-19 and cannot pass the virus to the vulnerable patient with a hematologic malignancy. The only people without immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in this scenario are children under the age of 12 and the person with the hematologic malignancy.",
