Schematic representation of important metabolic reactions in normal cells, including (a) glycolysis, (b) pentose phosphate pathway, (c) tricarboxylic acid cycle, (d) glutaminolysis, and (e) lipid metabolism. Nutrient transporters and metabolic enzymes are depicted in light blue. GLUT, glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase; GPI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; ALD, fructose bisphosphate aldolase; PK, pyruvate kinase; G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; MCT, monocarboxylate transporters; ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; GOT1/2, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1/2; GLS, enzyme glutaminase.

  "figure_2": "Brain metastatic process. Metastatic brain cancer predominantly originates from lung, breast, and melanoma tumors. Metastasis is a complex multistep process that comprises (1) local tissue invasion into adjacent tissues, (2) intravasation into the circulatory system and survival in the bloodstream, (3) extravasation to brain pre-metastatic sites, and (4) colonization and proliferation in the brain metastatic site.

  "figure_3": "Interplay between the most relevant metabolic pathways, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors. Schematic representation of important metabolic reactions in cancer cells, including (a) glycolysis, (b) the pentose phosphate pathway, (c) the TCA cycle, (d) glutaminolysis, and (e) lipid metabolism. In BM, not only is glycolysis increased, but also the OXPHOS pathway, glutaminolysis, and lipid metabolism seem to be upregulated. Relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including MYC, HIF1α, mTOR, AKT, and TP53, are depicted in green when stimulating or in red when repressing mediators. Nutrient transporters and metabolic enzymes are depicted in light blue.
