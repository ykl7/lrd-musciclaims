(A) Polygonal skin islands are separated by dark furrows (arrow); the furrows correlate to skin surface folds (dermatoglyphics). The stratum corneum presents as a “wrinkled”-appearing bright sheets (circle). A refractile long cylindrical tube correlating to a hair shaft is observed (arrowhead). (B) Regular honeycomb pattern of the granular and spinous layers seen with RCM. Dark holes of regular size, correlating to nuclei of keratinocytes (arrow) and bright lines with uniform thickness and reflectivity, correlating to cytoplasm of keratinocytes and intercellular connections, are seen. (C) Dark, round to oval dermal papillae surrounded by a slightly brighter rim of pigmented basal keratinocytes and melanocytes (“edged papillae”) are observed at the DEJ (arrows). (D) Within the papillary dermis, a web-like pattern of bright collagen fibers is seen (circle). The bright, centrally hollow structure (arrow) is a sweat duct; spiraling of the epidermal portion of the sweat duct (acrosyringium) through the epidermis can be seen when sequential images are obtained along the z-axis (“Vivastack”)",

The majority of the nests appear as “dense clusters” that are homogenous in brightness and in which individual melanocytes are mostly unapparent; however, “sparse nests,” which correspond to discohesive aggregates of atypical melanocytes, are also seen (arrow). b On high magnification RCM (500 × 500 μm field-of-view) of the upper epidermis, sparse nests appear as aggregates of nucleated cells of variable reflectivity, in which the individual cells are discernible. c High magnification RCM (500 × 500 μm field-of-view) at the level of the superficial dermis shows “cerebriform nests.” Cerebriform nests are confluent aggregates of low reflecting cells (melanocytes) in the dermis that are separated by a darker rim, resulting in a multilobate appearance",
