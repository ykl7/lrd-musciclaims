A, TIL-B quantification by IHC within normal breasts and TNBC (N = 15 each, Bart's IHC cohort), and by GEx (normal breast) vs. TNBC (N = 10 vs. 131, KCL GEx cohort); non-TNBC vs. TNBC (N = 515 vs. 123, TCGA GEx cohort); TNBC subtypes [mesenchymal (M), luminal androgen receptor (LAR), basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1 and 2), and immunomodulatory (IM; N = 122, KCL GEx cohort]. The Mann–Whitney test was used for statistical significance. B, TNBC TIL-B correlation with TIL-T by IHC (r = 0.72, Bart's IHC cohort) and by GEx (r = 0.73, KCL GEx cohort). Linear regression analysis was used to calculate correlation coefficients (r) and P values. C, B lymphocyte metagene NanoString GEx data comparing B lymphocytes in primary tumors with metastatic sites (N = 31 vs. 17; NanoString cohort). D, High (above median) TIL-B densities by IHC were associated with better overall survival in TNBC (N = 15; Bart's IHC cohort), and in the basal-like subtype by high CD20 GEx (N = 241; KM plotter cohort; log rank test used to assess statistical significance). E, Kaplan–Meier survival curves display DMFS for naïve B cells, plasma cells, and memory B cells in TNBC (KCL GEx cohort) using CIBERSORT (20). Data were divided into four groups based on B lymphocyte subset and TIL levels stratified by semiquantitative TIL classification. Statistical significance was assessed using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. F, Representative IHC/IF images (Bart's IHC cohort) depicting nucleated cells (DAPI), epithelial cells (PanCK), B lymphocytes (CD20), and T lymphocytes (CD3) within TNBC TIL-Blow and TIL-Bhigh lesions.

Scale bar, 50 μm. B, Quantitative assessment of TIL-B spatial and structural characteristics within TNBC (N = 15; left) intratumoral versus stromal; clustered versus dispersed (right). Patients ranked according to CD20+ TIL-B density (TNBC1 = highest), and overall survival data are indicated. Inset, patient samples split at median density into high and low TIL-B groups and the percentage of intratumoral (left) or clustered (right) B lymphocytes were analyzed. Statistical significance was determined using the Student t test. C, Characterization of TNBC TIL-B profile as stromal clustered, intratumoral clustered, stromal dispersed, or intratumoral dispersed. Overall survival data are indicated.
