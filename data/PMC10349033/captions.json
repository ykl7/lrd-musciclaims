  "figure_2": "Interactions among breast cancer, innervation, and brain metastasis. Workflow of how stress or other stimulations interact with the peripheral nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves), including through the HPA axis, leading to the release of several neurotransmitters and hormones and promoting breast cancer growth and brain metastasis. In turn, the tumor cells in the metastatic site promote tumor growth directly or indirectly through neurons",
  "figure_3": "Signaling pathways of innervation and therapeutic targets in primary or metastatic breast cancer microenvironment. In the microenvironment of primary or metastatic breast cancer sites, there are complicated interactions among synapses from surrounding nerves, metastatic breast cancer cells, breast cancer cells, and immune cells. Neurotransmitter release, related receptors, and signaling pathways are included in this model. Furthermore, several effective drugs mentioned in the text are shown in red text"
