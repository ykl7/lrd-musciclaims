Increased expression of receptors such as transferrin, integrins and LDL receptors facilitate the receptor-mediated uptake of drug-carrying nanoformulations. (B) Cell- and viral-mediated BBB crossing. Various stem cells, neutrophils, and viral vectors can cross the BBB carrying nanomedicine. (C) Physico-chemical (transient) disruption of the BBB. Focused ultrasound can decrease the structural proteins of tight junctions, namely, claudins and occludin. It can also increase the expression of calcium-activated channels for the delivery of nanomedicine. (ASCs: Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells; BBB: Blood brain barrier; BM-MSCs: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; LDL: Low-density lipoprotein; MSCs: Mesenchyma stem cells; NSCs: Neural stem cells; KCa: Calcium-activated potassium channels).",
