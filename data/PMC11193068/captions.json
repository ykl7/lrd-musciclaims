The low-contrast appearance of both eyes views is not representative of patient's perception, where both views are perceived in full contrast in binocular viewing. (B) Illustration of double vision using cartoons. The cartoons maintain the full contrast of both images. The two colors are not representative of the real views; the blue lines mark the left eye's view. In this illustration, the left eye is deviating to the right (esotropia); hence, the blue scene is shifted leftward (uncrossed diplopia). Binocular visual confusion is also illustrated in both A and B, where images of two different objects are superimposed, representing them to be perceived in the same direction.",
  "figure_2": "A cartoon of a savannah scene as seen by a patient with 20° (∼40Δ) left exotropia (left eye deviated to left). (A) The visual fields of both eyes (field diagram): the left eye's field in blue and the right, fixating eye, in black. The fixation point of the right eye is marked with a  symbol. The foveal direction of the deviated left eye is marked with an  symbol. (B) A perception diagram (Apfelbaum et al., 2013) as seen with double vision by that patient. Objects seen by the left eye are shown in blue. Many of the animals are seen twice (diplopia) as they fall on non-corresponding retinal loci. Many of them appear superimposed on others (visual confusion), as different animals fall on corresponding loci in both eyes. The rhinoceros on the left and the hippopotamus on the right are neither seen as diplopic nor visual confusion as each is seen by only one eye, because their images fall on the monocular peripheral crescent fields that have no corresponding retinal loci in the other eye. The elliptical pond is seen only by the right eye, its’ image falls on a retina that has corresponding locus in the other eye (where the blue cub is imaged in the left eye), and thus, they appear superimposed. While the cub is also diplopic, the pond is seen only once (no diplopia). The tiger seen by the right eye is also seen by the left eye (diplopic), but the right eye copy appears not to be confused. This is not the case; it is indeed confused with an area of the plain background seen by the left eye, but that confusion is not apparent in the cartoon illustration (blank area).",
  "figure_3": "Binocular visual confusion only (without diplopia) in peripheral field loss with strabismus. (A) Dichoptic binocular visual field of a patient with peripheral field loss and left manifested esotropia (15°) obtained with a dichoptic perimeter (Woods, Apfelbaum, & Peli, 2010). Because the two eyes’ residual central fields have corresponding retinal loci (central field in both eyes) but are not overlapping due to the eye deviation, the patient perceives only the visual confusion without diplopia. Therefore, the field of view with bilateral tunnel vision and tropia is wider than without tropia. (B) The dichoptic field diagram depicted in A is superimposed over the terminal scene. At that instant, the patient is fixating the group of three pedestrians ahead with his dominant right eye (red outlined) and may not be aware of either the closer man or the woman. (C) The percept diagram (patient's view) at that instance. The three passengers seen with the right eye (red edges) are superimposed over the terminal right blank wall and columns (blue edges) seen by the left eye (visual confusion). The lack of details on the blank wall makes this confusion inconsequential. (D) The terminal scene a few seconds later with the patient walking forward faster than the other people in the terminal do. The patient will be closer to the people ahead, and the “magnified” scene will move the woman into the left eye residual field. (E) The percept diagram at that later instance. Since each eye sees different and salient parts of the scene (two pedestrians and the woman, respectively), the visual confusion gives rise to the potentially beneficial field expansion effect. This, however, will also result in a much more noticeable/disturbing central confusion.",
  "figure_4": "Schematic illustration of a mechanism for the dissociation of the two eyes in tunnel vision because of change of fixation in three-dimensional space. (A) Starting from a fixation on the closer woman's head with both eyes fused and with the limited field of view includes both the woman and one of the group of men farther away within the fixating right eye's residual field. (B) As the patient changes fixation to the distant man, first saccading with the fixating right eye before any divergence movement may be completed. Under this fleeting situation with tunnel vision, there is no diplopic image of the man in the left eye and the esophoric deviation manifests as a tropia. (C) If the patient has a pre-existing exophoria, the left eye will diverge toward the exophoria posture. When the fields of view of both eyes overlap enough to result in diplopia of the right distant man, the binocular divergence will ensue ending with fusion of that farther man. (D) The slower divergence movement that should follow to reestablish binocular fixation does not take place if the patient had a preexisting esophoria. If the patient has a preexisting esophoria, the left eye may be drifting to the right or the left, depending on the magnitude of the phoria. The esophoria shifts the left eye farther right and resulting in the confusion only illustrated here and in Figures 3D and 3E.",
  "figure_5": "BTH. (A) An illustration of the optical neural pathway with the chiasm severed, resulting in both eyes losing the temporal fields. Left eye sees the right hemifield, and right eye sees the left hemifield without any binocular overlapping field of view. This is the case if the patient was orthophoric before the injury to the chiasm. (B) The percept diagram of the airport scene as seen by a patient with BTH and no phoria shown in A. (C) If a patient had exophoria prior to the damage to the chiasm, it becomes manifested as (right) exotropia with crossed diplopia. Vertical stripes areas of the field of view of both retinas, as wide as the angular magnitude of the tropia, are overlapping and thus pointing to the same objects that are perceived in diplopia (see crosshatched area in the inset). (D) The percept diagram, the airport as seen by the patient in C who fixating with left eye. The right eye nasal (left) hemifield sees further into the right hemifield (the strip includes the tall man with a shoulder bag) and thus duplicates a section of the same view seen by the nasal field of the left eye right hemifield). Every object within that strip (i.e., floor tiles and windows) is seen in crossed diplopia, but there is no visual confusion anywhere in the field of view of the patient (pure diplopia). Because of the right exotropia, the part of the far-left field seen by right eye (the left-most window seen in B) is missing from D. The diplopic areas here are limited in lateral extent and are only as wide as the angular magnitude of the strabismus. Note that here the diplopic images are seen at full contrast due to no visual confusion unlike the low contrast depicted in Figure 1A.",
  "figure_6": "BTH with right esotropia. (A) An illustration of the primary visual pathway with the chiasm severed, resulting in loss of the temporal fields in each eye. If a patient had esophoria prior to the damage to the chiasm, it becomes manifested as (right) esotropia. A vertical strip (gap) between the fields of view of both eyes, as wide as the angular magnitude of the phoria/tropia, is not visible to either eye (see grey vertical strip scotoma in the binocular field inset). (B) Percept diagram, the airport scene as seen by the patient in (A) who is fixating with left eye. The right eye nasal (left) hemifield sees further to the left (a strip in the scene including the smaller two men images) is not visible to either eye. The missing content at the center (to the left of the man with the shoulder bag) is not noticeable without careful examination of contents continuity. There is no diplopia or confusion. (C) The visual fields of another patient with BTH because of a chiasmal tumor, resulting in severe peripheral nasal fields’ reduction in addition to the complete BTH and in this case also right esotropia. The left shift of the right eye residual nasal field causes the 15° gap in the binocular field of view between the two eyes. Despite the similarity of this visual field diagram to that depicted in Figure 3A, there is neither confusion nor diplopia here. (D) The same field diagram, as in C that also shows the portions of the terminal scene seen with the residual fields shown in C. (E) The percept diagram of the patient with the field shown in C in the terminal with the same fixation of the left dominant eye as in B presented enlarged. The two foveae directions coincide in the perception diagram. Note that here too, because there is no confusion, the image can be presented with full contrast.",

(B) Field diagram. Left hypophoria manifests as left hypotropia results in vertical hemifield slide (right hemifield, seen by left eye, is shifted lower). (C) A percept diagram with face seen by a patient with BTH and left hypotropia without pure diplopia or confusion. No object is seen twice, but different parts of the same objects (i.e., nose or mouth) are seen at different vertical directions, creating an impression of vertical diplopia over the whole field. This is not pure diplopia, and we call it vertical “split diplopia.”",

(B) Percept diagram of the view of the airport terminal as seen by the patient in A. Oblique pure diplopia over a central area of the scene is seen without confusion. (C) Dichoptic visual field of a patient with BTH and preexisting right hyperphoria combined with (right) esophoria manifesting as right hypertropia and esotropia resulting in a vertical central scotoma. (D) Percept diagram of the view of the airport terminal as seen by the patient in C. One pedestrian and half of another are missing from the view, although it is not obvious without careful examination. There is no diplopia and no confusion in this situation. Split diplopia may be noticed over the upper windows. At the same time, split confusion can be discerned on the floor by comparing to the vertical misalignments of the tiles in D. In both lateral phoria cases, full contrast is maintained. Note here that the right hyperphoria resulted in right hypertropia whereas in Figure 7 the equivalent left hypophoria resulted in left hypotropia that is different than right hypertropia.",

(F) Percept diagram of the patient in E when viewing the airport scene exhibiting an oblique pure diplopia (the woman's shirt is seen diplopically in the lower field shifted to the left and down by right eye) without confusion and with just a hint of horizontal split diplopia. In all cases, the full contrast is maintained in these simulations, so there is no need to use the cartoon images. Note that the upper and lower residual fields are shifted in the field diagrams but remain aligned in the percept diagrams. Only the content of the residual fields is shifted within the percept diagrams.",

(C) Field diagram and (D) percept diagram of right HH with ipsilateral adult onset (right) exotropia.

While the same field expansion is achieved centrally (the woman) as in C, the farthest left periphery is missing. (G) Field diagram and (H) percept diagram of contralateral exotropia. The field expansion here is achieved in the farthest periphery, it is of minimal benefit and thus inconsequential. (I) Field diagram and (J) percept diagram of ipsilateral esotropia.

  "figure_11": "The interaction of HH with suppression in patients with childhood strabismus. Here a patient with right HH with childhood onset ipsilateral (right) exotropia is illustrated. (A) The field diagram illustrates half elliptics suppression of the right eye (adapted from Jampolsky (1955)). The vertical strip of the right eye field of view, which is not overlapping with the left eye's view (no diplopia but visual confusion only), is not supppressed, as described by Economides and Horton (2021). The blue and black thin lines rectangles represent the areas seen by the left and right eyes, respectively, in the percept diagram in B. (B) In the percept diagram, the unsuppressed right eye view (woman in black) in the section highlighted by red dashed lines represents the field expansion as a consequence of peripheral confusion (is visible only by the right exotropic eye). The pericentral part of the deviated right eye's retina is suppressed and prevents diplopia within the central part of the fixated left eye (i.e., the bag held in the woman's left hand and the leg of the guy in far). As a result, the three people in blue in the left eye's field of view are seen in diplopia but not in confusion. Outside of the suppressed area, within the overlapping field-of-view (crossed hatched in A), both diplopia and confusion are notable.",

(A) Schematic dichoptic binocular visual field diagrams illustrating field of view expansion, evident to the right of the vertical midline both above and below. The field expansion is of larger lateral magnitude the farther vertically it is from the fovea. The crosshatched area is seen in torsional double vision. The lateral and vertical magnitude of the diplopia and confusion in this area is minimal centrally and increases gradually with eccentricity, so that it is likely to exceed the Panum's area in the periphery while remaining in single binocular vision centrally. Here with intorsion, the superior field expansion is by the right eye and the inferior field expansion is by the left eye. (B) Percept diagram for the patient shown in A compared with (C) the percept diagram of a patient with the same Right HH but with no tortional strabismus.

In the percept diagram D, upper and lower parts of the woman on the blind right side are shifted into the upper and lower periphery of the left seeing field (black as the right eye view), which are superimposed over the left eye view (blue) causing visual confusion.

(F) In the percept diagram, upper and lower parts of the woman in the blind side are also shifted into the upper and lower periphery of the seeing field (blue representing the left eye views) and are confused with the right eye view (shown in black). Because of the higher power, the woman in the blind side is located farther peripherally than with Fresnel prism in D enabling view of farther to the right wall and columns. Because of the proper fitting of the peripheral prisms (i.e., the angular extent of the peripheral prisms within the seeing field is the same as the prism power in degrees), there is no diplopia near the primary position of gaze.",
