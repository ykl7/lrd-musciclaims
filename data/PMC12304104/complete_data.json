(E) Correlation Between CNV and mRNA Expression. The positive correlation between CNV and mRNA expression for CDKN2A and CDKN2B in both LGG and GBM is depicted, indicating that increases in CNV are generally accompanied by elevated mRNA expression levels.

Methylation sites cg03935379 (TERT), cg08390209 (CDKN2B), and cg14069088 (CDKN2A) are identified as independent prognostic factors in LGG but not in GBM.

(A) Comparison of cellular infiltration in the tumor microenvironment across multiple LGG and GBM cohorts using various algorithms (CIBERSORT, EPIC, etc.). CDKN2B-AS1 expression shows positive correlations with immune-activating cells (e.g., CD8 + T cells, M1 macrophages) and negative correlations with immunosuppressive cells (e.g., Tregs, M2 macrophages). However, these correlations vary across different algorithms and cohorts. (B) Immunomodulator analysis reveals that CDKN2B-AS1 is positively correlated with antigen presentation genes (e.g., HLA-F, HLA-DMA) and several immune-activating and inhibitory genes. This indicates a dual role in promoting immune activation while potentially regulating suppression processes. (C, D) Differential expression analysis of TCGA-LGG cohort groups based on CDKN2B-AS1 expression levels shows that high expression is enriched in pathways related to ncRNA processing and apoptosis, while low expression is linked to pathways associated with synaptic transmission and gated channel activity. KEGG pathway analysis further indicates distinct enrichment profiles for both groups. (E) Comparison of gene alterations between high and low CDKN2B-AS1 expression groups reveals no significant differences in frequently mutated genes or chromosomal regions. (F–I) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicates that genes positively correlated with CDKN2B-AS1 are enriched in pathways related to immune response and DNA replication, while negatively correlated genes are linked to calcium signaling. Hallmark analysis shows enrichment in interferon responses and DNA repair pathways for positively correlated genes. Overall, high CDKN2B-AS1 expression is associated with enhanced cell growth, immune activation, and apoptosis, suggesting a role in tumor progression, whereas low expression is linked to neural signaling processes, potentially affecting the tumor microenvironment.",

(A–C) In the GBM cohorts, the correlation between CDKN2B-AS1 expression and RNA modification-related genes (m1A, m5C, m6A) was explored, revealing variable results. (D, E) Differential expression analysis in the TCGA-GBM cohort, grouped by CDKN2B-AS1 expression levels, showed that the high expression group is enriched in pathways related to DNA damage response, DNA repair, and chromatin binding. In contrast, the low expression group is associated with sensory perception and olfactory receptor activity. KEGG analysis indicated that high expression is related to cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, while low expression is linked to p53 signaling and fatty acid degradation. (F) The high CDKN2B-AS1 expression group in GBM exhibited elevated mutation rates in TP53, SPTA1, and RB1, with notable copy number alterations, including losses at 12q.14.1 and 17p.13.1 and gains at 9p21.3. (G–J) GSEA analysis revealed that genes positively correlated with CDKN2B-AS1 are enriched in pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle regulation, while negatively correlated genes are linked to potassium ion response and protein folding. Hallmark analysis further indicated enrichment in E2F targets and G2M checkpoint pathways. Overall, these findings suggest that high CDKN2B-AS1 expression in GBM is significantly associated with DNA damage response and repair, indicating a role in maintaining genomic stability.
