  "figure_1": "From eye orientation to higher-order eye-tracking measures. This is a crude division of the process from eye orientation to higher-order eye-tracking measures. There may be cases where a more fine-grained division is applicable",
  "figure_2": "Characteristics of eye-tracking data quality. A Horizontal gaze position (in Fick, 1854, coordinates, see Haslwanter (1995)) of the right eye as a function of time. The gaze position was recorded from an adult participant with an EyeLink 1000 by Hooge et al., (2015). Call-outs indicate the relatively precise gaze-position signal (compared with panel B). B Horizontal gaze position in Fick coordinates of the right eye as a function of time. The gaze position was recorded from an infant participant with the Tobii TX300 by Hessels et al., (2016). Call-outs indicate the relatively imprecise gaze-position signal (compared with panel A), short gaps in the gaze-position signal (data loss), and an extreme gaze position reported by the eye tracker. The extreme gaze position is interesting because it can be considered an aspect of eye-tracking data quality not captured in the measures accuracy, precision, or data loss. C, D Gaze position signals (black dots) in a 2D representation, i.e. as if on a screen. Gaze position signals were recorded from adult participants by Hooge et al., (2019). Gaze position samples with high velocity were removed such that saccades are not visible. Orange markers represent validation targets. They are positioned to illustrate good/poor accuracy and do not correspond to the location of the actual validation targets in the experiment by Hooge et al., (2019). Call-outs indicate validation targets with corresponding precise and accurate, precise and inaccurate, imprecise and accurate, and imprecise and inaccurate gaze position signals, respectively. Note that the qualifications ‘precise’, ‘imprecise’, ‘accurate’, and ‘inaccurate’ are relative here and are often quantified",
  "figure_3": "Example of a head-boxed eye-tracking setup. The setup consists of a participant, eye tracker (camera and IR illuminator) and a computer screen. The geometry of this setup can be described by the relative orientations and distances of the monitor, camera and IR illuminator, and participant. Some eye trackers have a fixed relation with the computer screen (e.g. Tobii Pro Spectrum), while others do not and allow for more adjustments (e.g. SR Research EyeLink 1000). Note that the eye-tracker distance and screen distance are not identical. Screen height and width refer to both the physical and the pixel measures"
