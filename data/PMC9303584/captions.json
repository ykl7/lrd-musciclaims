  "figure_1": "Skin carcinogenesis. Schematic representation of three steps in the process of carcinogenesis initiated by causative factors and a proposed mechanism of melanoma progression. Each stage of the depicted process includes associated mutations in key genes, changes in the cells, and the reversibility of the process [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
  "figure_2": "The molecular pathways in skin cancers. Objects highlighted in blue color symbolize RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, also known as the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The oncogenes outlined in the green have been identified as the most common oncogenes with somatic mutations in skin cancer, especially melanoma. Presented pathways and steps, connected by arrows showing interdependencies, represent complex signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation or apoptosis [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
