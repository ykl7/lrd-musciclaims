CyCIF is a robust tool for the investigation of the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, by linking the cell type with spatial information. (A, B) are from the same formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) slide and (C, D) are both from serial sections of a primary breast tumor (invasive ductal carcinoma, HR+HER2-).",
