  "figure_1": "Highlights of DCIS-IDC research. Since DCIS was termed as the precursor of IDC in 1973, research on the transition from DCIS to IDC has rapidly advanced. This progress has been fueled by the establishment of in vitro DCIS cell lines and in vivo animal models. In recent years, technological advancements have offered deeper insights into the changes occurring in both tumor cells and the microenvironment during the transition from DCIS to IDC",
  "figure_2": "Key signaling pathways in breast cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by diverse subtypes. The development and progression of breast cancer result from the influence of subtype-specific and shared signaling pathways, as well as the intricate crosstalk between them. Inhibitors that target these key signaling pathways have led to improvement in the prognosis of breast cancer.

  "figure_3": "Proposed models of DCIS progression. a Independent lineage model, which presumes that DCIS and IDC derive from two distinct normal epithelial cells which share no overlapping CNAs or mutations. b Evolutionary bottleneck model, which presumes that a specific clone within DCIS is selected and it evolves into IDC. c Multiclonal invasion model, which presumes that multiple clones escape and co-migrate to invasive regions to generate IDC. d Convergent phenotype model, which presumes that subclones of different genotypes within DCIS can all give rise to an invasive phenotype to establish IDC",
  "figure_4": "Role of microenvironment in DCIS progression. Tumor-microenvironment crosstalk may facilitate DCIS progression. The environment consists of a range of components including MECs, immune cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, basement membrane and ECM. a MECs: Upregulation of αvβ6 integrin expressed in MECs activates TGFβ signaling, resulting in upregulation of MMP9 and MMP13 and ECM remodeling. Moreover, increased secretion of CXCL12 and CXCL14 from MECs promotes DCIS tumor cell invasion. b Immune cells: DCIS cell-derived CCL2 recruit macrophages into the tumor, driving increased Wnt-1 secretion from macrophages, contributing to myoepithelium disruption and the breakdown of E-cadherin junctions. c Fibroblasts: Increased secretion of CXCL1 and IL-6 from CAFs drives activation of NF-κB and COX-2 in DCIS cells, which induced and upregulation of MMP9 and MMP14 from DCIS cells, resulting in ECM remodeling and basement membrane degradation.

  "figure_6": "Future management of non-progressive and progressive DCIS. Historically, distinguishing between progressive and non-progressive DCIS in women was challenging, resulting in overtreatment with limited benefits. It is crucial to find a solution to this problem. Advanced technologies, such as experimental models, multi-omics, single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, can facilitate the development of a risk stratification system for personalized treatment. Tailoring treatments for non-progressive DCIS differently from progressive DCIS is essential to alleviate the unnecessary burdens associated with overtreatment"
