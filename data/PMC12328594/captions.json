  "figure_1": "A Adult P. canaliculata. B Eye bulb and eye stalk with cornea (dashed line). C Isolated optic nerve and retina with the lens enclosed in it. D Isolated lens held with tweezers in front of a paper with the letter F printed in font size 5. E Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of P. canaliculata eye longitudinal sections. Cornea (dashed line on the left), anterior chamber (red arrow), lens (orange arrow), posterior chamber, retina, optic nerve and surrounding connective tissue, muscle tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) can be distinguished. The 2 insets highlight the cornea and the anterior part of the lens (blue dashed line) and a portion of the retina (black dashed line). In the latter, a photoreceptor (white dashed line), the photoreceptor outer segments (yellow arrow), pigment granules (green arrow), photoreceptor inner segments (blue arrow) and neuropile (purple arrow) are shown. Arrows in (E) and images in (F–K) have the same color-code. TEM images of (F) anterior chamber filled with ECM; G lens with a densely packed structure; H outer segment of rhabdomeric photoreceptors characterized by microvilli; I pigment granules; J densely packed photic vesicles occupy an extensive portion of the photoreceptor cytoplasm together with rare mitochondria (white arrowhead) and ribosomes (black arrowheads), n nucleus; K neuropile, or bundle of axons forming the optic nerve, filled with heterogeneous vesicles. The images showed in (E–K) are representative of data collected through three independent experiments. L Schematic representation of eye anatomy for human (Hs), apple snail (Pc) and Drosophila (Dm). M Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of P. canaliculata (Pc) genes bioinformatically defined as orthologs of human (Hs) and/or fly (Dm) genes. For this analysis only GO terms related to eye development and function were taken into consideration. The plot shows the number of genes for each GO term that can be found in both snail and human but not in fly (first row), in snail, human and fly (middle row), or in snail and fly but not in human (last row). Adjusted p value cutoff of 1e−5. Manually selected representative terms (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1).",

B–E Longitudinal sections of the eye stalk during eye regeneration time course stained with either H&E (top images) or anti-BrdU (magenta) and anti-H3P (cyan) (central and bottom row of images). The dashed lines represent where the cut for eye amputation was performed. BrdU and H3P positive cells where counted in the tissue above the dashed lines. F Quantification of BrdU positive cells in the regenerating tissue area during the eye regeneration time course. n = 3 snails for 6 and 12 dpa; n = 4 snails for Intact and 1 dpa; n = 5 snails for 3, 9, 15 and 28 days post amputation (dpa); n = 6 snails for 21 dpa; for each sample 4 sections were analyzed; non-parametric Kruskal−Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post hoc multiple comparisons test determined statistical differences between regenerating samples and Intact eye; adjusted p values are <0.0001 for 6 and 9 dpa, 0.0035 for 12 and 21 dpa and 0.0009 for 28 dpa. G Quantification of the eye bulb area during the eye regeneration time course. n = 3 snails/time point, 3 sections each; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test determined statistical differences between samples; adjusted p values are 0.0046 for 15 vs 12 dpa, 0.0447 for 28 vs 21 dpa and <0.0001 for Intact vs 28 dpa.

  "figure_3": "A Schematic representation of the main morphologically defined time points during eye regeneration. Blastema/cell proliferation (yellow), lens (cyan), retina (red). B MDS plot of RNA-Seq samples collected during eye regeneration time course. Dimension 1 explains 41.8% of variance and Dimension 2 13.72%. n = 4 samples/time point (5 animals/sample) (see Supplementary Fig. 3A). C Number of differentially expressed (DE) genes (up-regulated in red and down-regulated in blue) compared to Intact samples [Log Fold Change (LogFC ≥ 0 and FDR ≤ 1e−5]. D GO enrichment analysis using significantly up-regulated genes (LogFC ≥ 0 and FDR ≤ 1e−5) in 1 dpa vs Intact and in 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21 and 28  dpa vs 1 dpa comparisons to highlight the features recovered throughout regeneration. GO terms used in this representation were manually selected from GO enrichment analysis run on the up-regulated genes obtained from comparing each time point with the previous one (p value ≤ 0.01, q value ≤ 0.05) (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 3B, C). E Heatmap of gene expression changes during eye regeneration time course. These genes represent the main stages of eye regeneration, and many of them are known, from previous studies, to be involved in vertebrate eye development (z scores calculated from TPMs). Gene categories on the right of the heatmap are based on GO annotations. F TEM images of the photoreceptor cytoplasm in the retina of Intact, 1, 2 and 3 months post amputation (mpa) eyes. Nuclei (yellow), photic vesicles (cyan), ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum (empty arrowhead) and mitochondria (full arrowhead). The images are representative of data collected through three independent experiments. G SEM images of the retina, photoreceptor microvilli and apical cilia observed in Intact and 3 mpa eyes. At both time points, the retina is constituted by long photoreceptors (empty arrowhead), neuropile (on the bottom, full arrowhead) and microvilli (on the top). The photoreceptor microvilli at 3 mpa show an apical flat and wide expansion of the membrane like the Intact eyes. Cilia (full arrow) have been observed intercalated in the photoreceptor microvilli both in Intact and 3 mpa retina. The images are representative of data collected through three independent experiments.",

Purple = PAX domain, orange = HOX domain, dark gray = disordered regions (see Supplementary Fig. 6).

  "figure_6": "A Schematic representation of the P. canaliculata pax6 genomic region, the gRNA target site, and the crossing strategy used to establish a stable mutant line and to obtain homozygous mutant animals (see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Data 5). B Images of wild-type and pax6−/− 9 dpf embryos and insets of the region at the base of the cephalic tentacle. Wild-type and pax6+/− animals have eyes while the pax6−/− snails lack all the eye bulb and eye stalk components. C The percentage of F2 embryos with the “lack of eye” phenotype corresponds to the expected 25%. n = 6 clutches. D Correlation between genotypes and phenotypes in F2 embryos shows that the lack of eyes corresponds to homozygous mutants. n = 3 clutches. E Confocal images of wild-type and pax6−/− embryos stained with phalloidin during a developmental time course. Phalloidin shows that at 4 dpf there is a first morphological evidence of eye formation through cell wall contraction in the cephalic area of the embryos. The red arrows point at the area where the eye develops (in wild-type and pax6+/− snails) or where it should be developing (in pax6−/− snails). F Still images of time lapses showing adult wild-type and pax6−/− snails free to move in their tanks (see Supplementary Movie 1). Data are represented as mean ± SEM."
