D Isolated lens held with tweezers in front of a paper with the letter F printed in font size 5. E Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of P. canaliculata eye longitudinal sections. Cornea (dashed line on the left), anterior chamber (red arrow), lens (orange arrow), posterior chamber, retina, optic nerve and surrounding connective tissue, muscle tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) can be distinguished. The 2 insets highlight the cornea and the anterior part of the lens (blue dashed line) and a portion of the retina (black dashed line). In the latter, a photoreceptor (white dashed line), the photoreceptor outer segments (yellow arrow), pigment granules (green arrow), photoreceptor inner segments (blue arrow) and neuropile (purple arrow) are shown. Arrows in (E) and images in (F–K) have the same color-code. TEM images of (F) anterior chamber filled with ECM; G lens with a densely packed structure; H outer segment of rhabdomeric photoreceptors characterized by microvilli; I pigment granules; J densely packed photic vesicles occupy an extensive portion of the photoreceptor cytoplasm together with rare mitochondria (white arrowhead) and ribosomes (black arrowheads), n nucleus; K neuropile, or bundle of axons forming the optic nerve, filled with heterogeneous vesicles.

M Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of P. canaliculata (Pc) genes bioinformatically defined as orthologs of human (Hs) and/or fly (Dm) genes. For this analysis only GO terms related to eye development and function were taken into consideration. The plot shows the number of genes for each GO term that can be found in both snail and human but not in fly (first row), in snail, human and fly (middle row), or in snail and fly but not in human (last row).
