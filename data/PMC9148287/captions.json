A panel of five brain cancer cell lines and the MRC5 line were treated with various concentrations of TMZ (A) or IQ10 (B) for 24, 48 or 72 h. Total cell numbers in drug-treated cultures were plotted as a percentage of the vehicle control for each time point. SNB19 was treated with higher doses (up to 5 µM) of IQ10 to reach 50% growth inhibition. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, with each experiment performed in triplicate. Cells (48-h time point) from growth assays were collected and plated for clonogenic survival assays (cells without drug treatment as control) (C and D). Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, with each experiment containing six parallel data sets. Plating efficiencies of individual cell lines were as follows: SNB19, 58 ± 9%; DAOY, 55 ± 10%; UW228-3, 92 ± 4%; SF188, 50 ± 9%; KNS42, 50 ± 6%; MRC5, 83 ± 8%.

DAOY and UW228-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of IQ10 for 24, 48 and 72 h (cells treated with DMSO as control) under normoxia or hypoxia. A Cell number was plotted as a percentage of control for each time point shows the 48-h time point response. The data for 24- and 72-h time points are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, with each experiment performed in triplicate. The subpanels of the Western images show increased expression of hypoxia marker CA9 following 48 h of hypoxic incubation in DAOY and UW228-3 cells, confirming the induction of hypoxia. N, normoxia; H, hypoxia. Cells from the 48-h time point, from growth assays, were collected and plated out for clonogenic survival assays (cells treated with DMSO as control).

Plating efficiencies for normoxia and hypoxia were 55 ± 10% and 61 ± 11% for DAOY and 92 ± 4% and 81 ± 12% for UW228-3, respectively. Black represents normoxia and red represents hypoxia. C DAOY and UW228-3 cells, grown in 2D or as 3D spheroids, were treated with various concentrations (0–1 μM) of IQ10 for 48 h (cells treated with DMSO as control). Cell viability was determined by resazurin reduction assay. Percentage of cell viability normalised to DMSO-treated control is shown. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, with each experiment performed in 6 replicate wells. D Clonogenic survival assays were performed to assess the surviving fraction of cells cultured in 2D or 3D spheroids. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, with each experiment containing six parallel data sets.

  "figure_5": "Effects of TrxR knockdown on the cytotoxicity of IQ10 in brain cancer cells. A Reduced TrxR expression after siRNA treatment in brain cancer cells. DAOY and SF188 cells were transiently transfected with 10 nM of TrxR siRNA or control scrambled siRNA. Transfection medium was removed after 48 h, replaced by fresh medium and incubated for an additional 72 h. Cells were collected at 3 or 5 days post-transfection and subjected to Western blotting to assess TrxR expression, with β-actin as an internal control. Data are expressed as an average percentage relative to the scrambled siRNA-treated control ± SD. Experiments were conducted three times, with separate cell lysates from different passage numbers of cells each time. Representative blots are shown. Black represents DAOY, and grey represents SF188. B Growth curve and C clonogenic survival assays were conducted to assess the cytotoxicity of IQ10 in siRNA transfected cells treated with various concentrations of IQ10 for 48 h.
