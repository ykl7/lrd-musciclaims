  "figure_1": "MiRNA sponging by circRNAs and lncRNAs. The central dogma proposes that protein-coding regions of the genome give rise to mRNAs, which are, in turn, translated into proteins. However, miRNAs, which are transcribed from the non-coding genome, could bind mRNAs via MREs and inhibit their translation. LncRNAs and, circRNAs, which are also transcribed from the non-coding genome, could bind and sponge miRNAs since they harbor MREs, resulting in the translation of the previously miRNA-inhibited mRNAs into proteins.

(A) Co-culture of drug-resistant with drug-sensitive cells leads to an exosomal ncRNAs-mediated switch into drug resistance. (B) Culture of drug-sensitive cells in drug-resistant BC-cells-conditioned media, which contains drug-resistant cell-secreted exosomes, leads to an exosomal ncRNAs-mediated switch into drug resistance.",
