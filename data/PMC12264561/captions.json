  "figure_1": "Brain tumor–astrocyte crosstalk modulating cancer progression. A: Astrocyte (blue) communication with glioblastoma (GB) cells in the tumor core (orange) includes paracrine signaling through chemokines, growth factors, or extracellular vesicles (EVs; purple), and physical interactions via gap junctions. Tumor-associated astrocytosis ignites GB progression via the release of interleukins and growth factors promoting tumor cell proliferation in the tumor core. For instance, astrocytic chemokines such as the monocyte chemoattractant protein-4 (MCP4), CXCL5, or the glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) have been shown to coordinate pro-invasive programs in GB cells at the leading edge. In turn, GB cells sustain astrocytosis by releasing, for example, tumor EVs containing reprogramming material such as long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and miRNAs. In addition, GB microenvironment composition contributes to astrocyte reactivity through factors such as the Wilms tumor protein (WT1). Physical connections between GB cells and astrocytes through gap junctions enable direct exchange of biological material, including miRNA. Through these connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated connections, reprogrammed tumor astrocytes provide shielding from therapies such as vincristine and temozolomide (bottom left insert). Naive/nonreactive astrocytes naturally release interleukins and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which have been shown to attract and support the extravasation of metastatic melanoma cells (dark brown) to the brain parenchyma. Similarly to GB cells, breast cancer brain metastatic cells (dark brown) are releasing EVs containing miRNAs (miR-1290), enabling remote reprogramming of astrocytes into tumor-supporting cells. B: The tumor core microenvironment fortifies epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both astrocytic and tumor cell populations. Tumor core crosstalk between astrocytes and GB cells promoting astrocytic EMT include tumor sourced factors (orange) such the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), epidermal growth factor (EGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and IL-6. Similarly, astrocyte-originating molecules (blue) strengthen mesenchymal (MES)-like phenotypes in GB cells. Those include the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), stromal-derived growth factor-1 (SDF-1/CxCL12), MMPs, TGF-β, vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF), FGF, and IL-6. Astrocyte-tumor paracrine signaling functions as a loop, overcharging cancer aggressiveness.

  "figure_2": "Brain tumor–neuron crosstalk modulating cancer progression. A: Glioblastoma (GB) cells are sensitive to neuronal synapse–specific neuroligin-3 (NLGN-3). Synapse formation and disconnection are coordinated by the active form of NLGN-3, cleaved from the membrane-bound immature form by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing 10 (ADAM10; yellow). On GB cells, NLGN-3 will potentiate the formation of neoplastic synapse ersatz, neuronal-like differentiation, and neuronal network integration. B: GB invasion classically co-opts the preexisting brain structures such as microvascular endothelium and myelinated neuronal tracts of the white matter. Cell invasion partially degrades the extracellular matrix (ECM), releasing myelin-rich cell debris. On GB cells, myelin has been shown to induce a differentiation toward an oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-like cell state associated with up-regulation of the oligo-specific transcription factor SOX10. Interestingly, therapies increasing myelin production leverages OPC-like hysteresis, as GBs with oligo components are typically less malignant. C: Typical neuronal signaling pathways including neurotransmitters and electrochemical communication have been shown to support brain cancer progression in patients. Among the neurotransmitters modulating brain tumor progression, glutamate plays a central role in tumor cell integration to neuronal networks. Neuron-sourced glutamate binds to two ionotropic receptors expressed by brain tumor cells. Those include fast-acting (<1 millisecond) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA; blue) and slower (>10 milliseconds) N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; red) receptors, both modulating neuronal calcium activity. AMPA receptors are expressed in GB cells located at the tumor core and leading edge. In the core, higher glutamate concentrations activate AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-supporting tumor cell proliferation. At the invasive front, neuronal glutamate evokes AMPA signaling, facilitating GB cell integration to neighboring neurons through cellular microtubes. When fully integrated to neuronal networks, GB cells up-regulate a cholinergic receptor [M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3)] hence taking advantage of additional neurotransmission initiated by neuronal acetylcholine. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are more specifically used by peripheral cancer cells progressing in the brain. Neuronal glutamate activates NMDARs expressed on synapses ersatz of brain metastatic cells. Interestingly, neurons can suppress brain tumor progression. Reduced tumorigenicity is mediated by the central inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and the carbonic anhydrases 10 and 11 (CA10/11) produced by neurons of the leading edge. Once integrated to neuronal networks, glioma cells can modulate neuronal activity and network stability using membrane-bound proteins (brown arrows) such as tweety family member 1 (TTYH1) and growth-associated protein (GAP43). TTYH1 enhances axon outgrowth, and GAP43 promotes neoplastic network formation and GB cell proliferation and invasion. Similarly, tumor cells secrete glypican-3 promoting synaptogenesis and neural hyperexcitability. Brain metastatic cells integrate into tripartite-like synapses involving neurons and astrocytes (bottom right insert). Reactive astrocytes produce the urokinase/tissue plasminogen activator (uPA/tPA) converting plasminogen into plasmin. Plasmin is known to be tumor suppressive, used as neural defense mechanism against brain metastasis. Metastatic tumor cells block plasminogen activation by secreting the uPA/tPA inhibitors neuroserpin and serpin 2B. TSP-1, thrombospondin 1."
