      "caption": "NPs can exploit several transport mechanisms to cross the BBB. Their small size is advantageous for paracellular transport across the TJs. Carrier-mediated transport takes advantage of endogenous BBB transporters needed for entry of molecules for homeostasis and neuronal health. Adsorptive-mediated transport processes occur via favorable interactions between the surfaces of NPs and the endothelial membrane, while receptor-mediated processes stem from recognition of a ligand on the NP by a membrane receptor. Membrane invagination results in internalization of the NPs into clathrin-coated pits or caveolae before exiting into the target tissue.",

(A) Gold NPs carrying the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin and the TAT peptide can cross the BBB through paracellular transport and AMT to reach tumor cells. The GNPs accumulate at the tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. (B) After internalization by the tumor cell, the GNPs are transported into lysosomes, where doxorubicin is released from its hydrazone linkage by the acidic microenvironment. The doxorubicin enters the nucleus and damages DNA by acting as an intercalator, resulting in apoptosis of tumor cells. (C) GNPs improve paracellular transport across the BBB by decreasing the level of phosphorylated PKCζ, an enzyme required for the proper association between ZO-1 and occluding at the tight junctions of endothelial cells.",
