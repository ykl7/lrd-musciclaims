  "figure_1": "Independent component analysis (ICA) of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC-MRI). Left - Temporal evolution of normalized T2* from arterial and venous component. Right – ICA derived Z-score probability maps (p < 0.5) for respective components for one representative patient. Results are overlaid on anatomical T1-weigthed post-contrast image. Sagittal plane representing selected slices (from left to right) to cover polygon of Willis, sagittal sinus and tumor region. Binarized arterio-venous (positive Z-score values) and overlap mask (AVOL) are overlaid to the T1-weigthed post-contrast image",
  "figure_2": "Multiparametric MRI images in patients with secondary brain metastasis from a) breast, b) NSCLC and c) clear cell kidney carcinoma. Pre- and post-contrast T1-weigthed, T2-weighted FLAIR, T1 subtraction (ΔT1 map), ADC, normalized rCBV and arterio-venous overlap (AVOL) maps for each representative patient. Inhomogeneous tumor lesions were defined and overlaid on ΔT1 map excluding central necrotic areas (red rectangles). T2-weighted FLAIR shows peri-enhancing edema on both breast and clear cell kidney carcinoma cases. ADC maps shows reduced diffusion values within solid component of the tumor (contrast enhancement) and increased diffusion in edematous component. This former region is characterized by hypoperfused blood volume (low rCBV) while solid component is mostly hyperperfused. AVOL maps are heterogeneous for both arterial and venous components while in clear cell kidney carcinoma case, tumor region is predominated by overlap map",
  "figure_4": "Results of arterio-venous and overlap maps from each subsequent brain metastatic group. Red, yellow and blue box plots representing respectively arterial, overlap and venous components. Statistical analyses are reported in bottom part for each component, across groups (left), as well as within each group and between components (right)",
  "figure_5": "Correlation between tumor rCBV (whole ΔT1 lesion mask) and proportion of ICA-derived components. No correlation was observed between arterial component and rCBV (a), venous component and rCBV (c). The overlap proportion (b) significantly correlates with rCBV in each subtype of metastatic brain lesion"
