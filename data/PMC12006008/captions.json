  "figure_1": "Cytogenetics, FISH and histomorphological findings of case #1. (A) Representative karyogram of a translocation 46,XX,t(3;12)(q26.2;p13) observed in 20/20 metaphases. Arrows indicate aberrant chromosomes. (B) FISH using dual-color break-apart probes for MECOM 3q26.2 demonstrating one normal fusion signal, one split signal for 5’ end region of MECOM (green), and one split signal for the 3’ end region of MECOM (red), consistent with rearrangement at MECOM locus. (C) FISH using dual-color break-apart probes for ETV6 at 12p13.1 demonstrating one normal fusion signal, one split signal for 5’ end region of ETV6 (red), and one split signal for the 3’ end region of ETV6 (green), consistent with rearrangement at ETV6 locus. (D, E): Bone marrow biopsy and touch prep showing dysplasia in erythroid precursors.",

Arrows indicate aberrant chromosomes. (B) FISH using dual-color break-apart probes for MECOM 3q26.2 demonstrating one normal fusion signal, one split signal for 5’ end region of MECOM (green), and one split signal for the 3’ end region of MECOM (red), consistent with rearrangement at MECOM locus.

(D) Bone marrow aspirate showing dysplasia in erythroid precursors with irregular nuclear contours, budding, basophilic stippling and megaloblastoid features, megakaryocyte with dysplasia and hypolobated morphology (inlet). (E) Ringed sideroblasts (iron stain)."
