(Abbreviations: ASCO, American Society of Clinical Oncology; CRC, colorectal cancer; US, United States).",
  "figure_2": "Pathogenesis of brain metastases. The development of brain metastases depends on a complex interplay of factors involving tumor cells migrating from an extracranial site into the vasculature via a series of epigenetic changes, proliferation of blood vessels, and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Once the tumor cells reach the brain, they traverse the blood brain barrier, which involves upregulation of genes and proteins involved in proteolysis, extracellular matrix destruction, and mitogenesis/growth. Once inside the brain, the cells must adhere to the brain endothelia and undergo further stimulatory processes to allow for proliferation.",

T1-weighted postgadolinium MRI of a right frontal brain metastasis displaying characteristic rim enhancement (left) and associated T2-weighted FLAIR sequence showing extensive surrounding vasogenic edema (right). (Abbreviations: FLAIR, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery; MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging).",
  "figure_4": "MRI-based appearance of radiation necrosis. A left parietal metastasis is shown prior to resection (top left) and postresection, preadjuvant stereotactic radiation (top right). Five years later, the patient developed enhancement at the treated site (bottom left), which enlarged with time (bottom right). The patient was taken to the operating room for resection, and the lesion proved to be radiation necrosis. (Abbreviations: MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging).",

LITT technique showing stereotactic laser fiber insertion to the target through a skull anchoring bolt (A) and MRI-based assessments before, during, and after LITT procedure (B). In Part (B), images reveal: (left) T1 and T2-weighted MRI showing regrowth of brain metastasis 12 months after radiosurgery; (left middle) intraoperative images displaying laser inserted into lesion; (right middle) 2-week post-LITT MRI showing postlaser ablation lesion increased in size but FLAIR signal improved; (right) MRI revealing resolution of lesion at 3 months post-LITT.

The top and bottom panel shows the planning magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans, respectively. The red, orange, yellow, and green dose-based shading depict the 33 Gy, 30 Gy, 27 Gy, and 16 Gy isodose lines, respectively."
