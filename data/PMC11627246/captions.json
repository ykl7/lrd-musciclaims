  "figure_1": "(A) Shows a sample videoframe of the dichoptic stimulus presented to both amblyopic eye and fellow eye. The amblyopic eye stimulus contains the amblyopic eye (AE) region of the dichoptic stimulus that is visible only to the amblyopic eye. The fellow eye stimulus contains the fellow eye (FE) region of the dichoptic stimulus that is visible only to the fellow eye. The transition region indicates the regions of transition from an AE region to an FE region and is visible to both eyes albeit at different contrast levels. (B) illustrates how the image will appear to participants who are able to perceive the stimulus presented to the fellow eye and amblyopic eye simultaneously during dichoptic viewing (in other words, the participant must be able to combine the stimuli presented to the fellow eye [FE region] and amblyopic eye [AE region] together to appreciate the entire image). It also has eye positions overlaid for controls (green), anisometropic (yellow), < 5Δ (blue), and > 5Δ (red) strabismic participants on the stimulus as color filled circles to demonstrate amblyopic eye and fellow eye (black edges) fixations within that videoframe. Examples of fixations in synchronous time, where both eyes are in the same region, asynchronous time, where each eye is within the video frame but are in different regions, and asynchronous time out, where only one eye is within the video frame while the other eye is outside the video frame are marked with their respective signs.",
  "figure_2": "Epoch of eye positions acquired over a 10 second period while watching dichoptic video clip from one subject. The plot shows filtered gaze coordinates (black) measured in degrees and eye movement events segmentation with periods of fixation (cream), pursuit (brown), and saccades (light green), as detected using REMoDNaV algorithm.",
  "figure_4": "Illustrates fixation behavior of participants 7 and 8 (anisometropic amblyopia) during the viewing of dichoptic videos. The snapshots were taken at each FE contrast level and overlaid with amblyopic eye and fellow eye positions. Subject 7 is fixating with both eyes on the stimulus presented to the fellow eye (FE region) at 100%, 50%, and 25% FE contrasts but fixates on stimulus presented to amblyopic eye (AE region) at 10% FE contrast. Subject 8, however, fixates on the stimulus presented in the fellow eye (FE region) only at 100% FE contrast but fixates on the stimulus presented in the amblyopic eye (AE region) at 50%, 25%, and 10% FE contrasts.  = synchronous time (amblyopic eye and fellow eye are in the same region). Fixation of the amblyopic eye within the amblyopic eye stimulus region is indicated by a red arrow pointing to the gaze position with a red shape surrounding the gaze position whereas fixation of the fellow eye within the fellow eye stimulus region is indicated by a black arrow pointing to the gaze position with a black shape surrounding the gaze position.",
  "figure_5": "Illustrates fixation behavior participants 11 and 12 (strabismic (< 5Δ) amblyopia participants) during viewing of dichoptic videos. Their fellow eye and amblyopic eye positions are overlaid on a video frame from each contrast of the dichoptic videos. Subject 11 has amblyopic eye fixing in the FE or transition region and not in the AE region for all 4 contrasts. Subject 12 had amblyopic eye fixing in the AE regions at 25% and 10% FE contrasts.  = synchronous time (amblyopic eye and fellow eye are in the same region);  = asynchronous time (amblyopic eye and fellow eye in different regions on the stimulus). Fixation of the amblyopic eye within the amblyopic eye stimulus region is indicated by a red arrow pointing to the gaze position with a red shape surrounding the gaze position whereas fixation of the fellow eye within the fellow eye stimulus region is indicated by a black arrow pointing to the gaze position with a black shape surrounding the gaze position.",
  "figure_6": "Illustrates fixation switch behavior of subjects 19 and 23 (strabismic > 5Δ amblyopia participants) during viewing of dichoptic videos. Their fellow eye and amblyopic eye positions are overlaid on a video frame from each contrast of the dichoptic videos. Subject 19 had their fellow eye fixating in the FE region at 100% FE contrast and amblyopic eye outside the video frame. However, at 50%, 25%, and 10% FE contrasts, the amblyopic eye is fixating in the AE regions and fellow eye is outside the video frame. Subject 23 has the amblyopic eye fixating outside of the video frame while fellow eye is fixating in the FE region or transition region and not in the AE region for all 4 FE contrasts. Fixation of the amblyopic eye within the amblyopic eye stimulus region is indicated by a red arrow pointing to the gaze position with a red shape surrounding the gaze position whereas fixation of the fellow eye within the fellow eye stimulus region is indicated by a black arrow pointing to the gaze position with a black shape surrounding the gaze position. △ = asynchronous out (one eye on the screen and the other eye outside the video frame).",

Controls (green), anisometropia (yellow), < 5Δ (blue), and > 5Δ (red). Asterisk (*) indicates statistically significant difference between groups evaluated at P < 0.05 for post hoc multiple pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction.",
