      "caption": "(A) Shows a sample videoframe of the dichoptic stimulus presented to both amblyopic eye and fellow eye. The amblyopic eye stimulus contains the amblyopic eye (AE) region of the dichoptic stimulus that is visible only to the amblyopic eye. The fellow eye stimulus contains the fellow eye (FE) region of the dichoptic stimulus that is visible only to the fellow eye. The transition region indicates the regions of transition from an AE region to an FE region and is visible to both eyes albeit at different contrast levels. (B) illustrates how the image will appear to participants who are able to perceive the stimulus presented to the fellow eye and amblyopic eye simultaneously during dichoptic viewing (in other words, the participant must be able to combine the stimuli presented to the fellow eye [FE region] and amblyopic eye [AE region] together to appreciate the entire image). It also has eye positions overlaid for controls (green), anisometropic (yellow), < 5Δ (blue), and > 5Δ (red) strabismic participants on the stimulus as color filled circles to demonstrate amblyopic eye and fellow eye (black edges) fixations within that videoframe. Examples of fixations in synchronous time, where both eyes are in the same region, asynchronous time, where each eye is within the video frame but are in different regions, and asynchronous time out, where only one eye is within the video frame while the other eye is outside the video frame are marked with their respective signs.",
