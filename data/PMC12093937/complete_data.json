      "caption": "The niche for normal and cancer skin stem cells. The illustration delineates the distinguishing characteristics between niche factors supporting normal SSC and skin CSC. The intricate and heterogeneous nature of the skin CSC niche is depicted through five primary features. 1 Epidermal homeostasis is disrupted by the redistribution of integrins (α6β4 and α3β1), resulting in elevated suprabasal integrin levels, and dysregulated maturation of LM332, which presents as unprocessed LM332, remaining the LG4–5 domain and full length of the β3 chain, or its subunit γ2 fragments. The Notch signaling pathway can become dysfunctional, in which Notch is downregulated, leading to the release of its inhibitory effects on stem cell proliferation, thereby inducing skin tumorigenesis. However, Notch1 and its ligands, DLL1 and JAG1/2, are highly expressed in tumor cells during skin cancer metastasis. These opposing functions of Notch signaling may be associated with the ectopic presence of DLL1 in tumor cells, which are typically confined to the SSCs of the epidermal basal layer, and increased expression of JAG1/2. Additionally, alterations in the affinity of Notch1 receptor for its ligands could further contribute to this complexity. This may result from reduced LFNG expression, which reinforces DLL1-Notch cis-inhibition (indicated by the light grey arrow) and inhibits JAG-Notch cis-inhibition in the physiological SSC niche (indicated by the light grey line), in progressive tumors. 2 Disruption of basement membrane integrity occurs through uncoupling of integrin from unprocessed LM332, breakdown of cadherin-mediated adhesion during EMT, and impairment of collagen IV, possibly induced by MMPs or miRNA-135b. Elevated MMP activity is sustained by CSCs, dysfunctional ECM proteins, and malignant cellular compartments, including CAFs, TAMs and TANs. The enhanced stiffness of the dermal matrix prompts the aberrant expression of integrins, which contribute to sustaining the stemness of CSCs. 3 Factors secreted by CSCs and tumor-associated cells, particularly CAFs, TANs, and TAMs, include molecules like VEGF and MMPs, which promote angiogenesis. 4 The continuous conversion of fibroblasts, monocytes, and neutrophils into CAFs, TAMs, and TANs, respectively, is imperative for maintaining the CSC niche. Concurrently, factors secreted by CSCs, fibrous ECM, and hypoxic conditions perpetuate the malignant traits of fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils. Additionally, the transition from E-cadherin to N-cadherin in adherens junctions, driven by the increased expression of SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST1, ZEB1/2, SIP1, and TCF3, as well as secreted factors from CSCs or tumor-associated cells like TGF-β, promotes metastasis and facilitates the recruitment of CAFs into the CSC niche. 5 The CSC niche sustains the survival of CSCs and tumor cells through multiple mechanisms. Cellular constituents within the CSC niche, including CAFs, TAMs, TANs, and Tregs, orchestrate an immunosuppressive TME, thereby inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function. Notably, soluble factors secreted by these immunosuppressive cells and CSCs, such as IL-10, CCL12, CXCR2 and IL-1β, promote Treg accumulation within the CSC niche and upregulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in both CSCs and tumor cells. CAFs can impair T cell function and increase T cell apoptosis by binding their FASL and PD-L1/2 to FAS and PD-1 receptors on T cells. CSCs further contribute to immune evasion by elevating PD-1 expression and downregulating MHC I/II expression on their surfaces. Endothelial cells (ECs) not only facilitate angiogenesis to nourish the CSC niche but also promote skin cancer metastasis through interactions with adhesive proteins on CSCs.

The schematic diagram emphasizes the core signaling pathways, demonstrating their role in orchestrating the physiological development of skin stem cells. Notably, Notch signaling promotes epidermal differentiation while also exerting negative control on Wnt and Shh signaling pathways to prevent unregulated epidermal proliferation. Under normal circumstances, the activity of YAP/TAZ is constrained by the Hippo pathway, accompanied by adherens junctions, which enhance the formation of the 14–3-3-YAP complex, leading to proteasomal degradation of YAP. Furthermore, α-catenin in adherens junctions binds to β-catenin, impeding its nuclear translocation of β-catenin, consequently inhibiting skin stem cell differentiation and maintaining the skin stem cell compartment.
