White boxes indicate the location of the zoomed-in views (upper right). The reddish stripes in the inner retina that are present in the dual-input reconstruction are induced by edge artefacts (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Of note, the artefacts disappear in the TRIPS reconstruction.

The en face intensity image (upper left) from a healthy human subject (32-yr-old male, OD, Asian) is rendered from a volume scan of the posterior eye. The corresponding corneal retardance (upper middle) and diattenuation (upper right) maps are extracted from the retinal surface and the optic axis images are reconstructed without (lower left) and with the correction for corneal retardance (lower middle), and for both retardance and diattenuation (lower right).

  "figure_8": "a, Nine repetitive scans modulated by triple polarization states of the guinea pig retina were acquired in-vivo. Different sets of 6 of the 9 repetitive scans were used to reconstruct the birefringence images with the dual-input method and TRIPS-OCT, respectively. For the dual-input method, the three scans modulated by the same input polarization state were averaged before birefringence reconstruction. For the triple input method, the two scans modulated by the same polarization state were averaged before birefringence reconstruction. The averaging was performed on the intensity images without considering the phase. This averaging process confirms that the acquisition time of the data used by the dual-input and triple-input methods for the birefringence reconstruction are identical. b, Birefringence images reconstructed from triple-input and dual-input methods using different combinations of the input polarization states. c, Birefringence noise characterization for the different combinations using the inner retina in Fig. a indicated by the orange area (pixel number n = 5117 from 1 cross-sectional image). Central lines of violin plots indicate mean. The improvement in noise performance using TRIPS-OCT is quite consistent between different combinations of Stokes vectors. The slight difference in the noise level of dual-input combinations is due to the dependency between the edge-artifacts and the absolute polarization states (Supplementary Discussion 1).

Black arrows indicate the observed edge-artifacts. c, Numerical model studying edge-artifacts and intensity profile variations. The sample is modelled by two nonbirefringent scattering layers under a transparent birefringent layer with random optic axis and a retardance of 20°. Intensity variation is created by changing the reflectivity of the scatterers within each layer. d, Numerical model studying birefringence noise and intensity signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The sample is modelled by a nonbirefringent scattering layer. White noise is added to the simulated fringes to create different SNRs. e, Numerical model studying birefringence noise and axial motion. Axial motion is modelled by a random shift of the sample along depth with a zero mean and a standard deviation σ. Scattering layers are modelled by scatterers embedded within nonbirefringent or birefringent media, creating fully developed speckle patterns in OCT scans. OCT scans are simulated by generating the fringes in wavenumber domain of the individual scatterers and then transforming the summed fringes into the depth domain using Fourier transformation with a resolution of 6 micrometres. Sixteen scans with independent speckle patterns are averaged to suppress the speckle noise before proceeding to birefringence reconstruction. Birefringence reconstruction (Supplementary Method 2) is performed by TRIPS, dual-input geometric reasoning, Jones matrix and single-input geometric reasoning. Data are presented as mean values +/− 95% confidence intervals, which are created by bootstrapping with n = 500 repetitive simulations on random optic axis and random positioning of the scatterers.",

  "figure_12": "a, Images of two adult guinea pig eyes without and with myopia. En face intensity images are obtained from an average projection along the depth. En face optic axis images are obtained from the outer layer of the sclera after flattening the images using the surface of the retina. White dotted lines indicate the locations of the cross-sectional images. The sclera is manually segmented in the cross-sectional images, and two regions of interest (ROIs) are selected in each image for localized comparison. The locations of cross-sectional image are roughly matched by the same relative position according to the optical nerve head. From the cross-sectional images, we observe thinning of the sclera tissue and deformation of the eye shape towards axial elongation in the highly myopic eye (−9 D). b, Histograms of measured birefringence and collagen fibre orientation in the entire sclera (left panel, pixel numbers n = 10399, 8477 for each region), ROI 1 (middle panel, pixel numbers n = 1269, 898 for each region) and ROI 2 (right panel, pixel numbers n = 1330, 784 for each region) from the cross-sectional images. Comparing the birefringence measurements, the average scleral birefringence increases in the myopic eye. The interweavement of collagen fibre, however, decreases as evidenced by that the local maxima in the angular histograms of the myopic eye are higher as compared to the emmetropic eye. As a result of scleral collagen remodelling, the increase in PSB in adult guinea pigs with myopia may be due to the augmented collagen fibre alignment and the reduction of interwoven fibres.

The boundaries of the ROIs are indicated by the dotted lines in the images. The choroidal-scleral interface is labelled manually. We observe that the average scleral birefringence is higher in patients with a higher degree of myopia, as well as an increase in the local maxima and a decrease in the local minima in the angular histograms of collagen fibre orientation. Specifically, in the eye with moderate myopia, there is a reduction in fibres oriented at 150° compared to the emmetropic eye. In the eye with high myopia, the collagen fibres at 60° completely disappear in the ROI. From this observation, we suppose that the increased PSB in patients with myopia is due to a decrease of the interweavement of the collagen fibres.
