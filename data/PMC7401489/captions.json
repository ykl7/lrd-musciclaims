(A) Fundus photographs from a 48-year-old Malay woman showing development of incident MMD (development of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy) over a follow-up of 6 years. (A1) Image from the left eye obtained at baseline visit (SE of –6.9 D and AL of 27.7 mm) showing fundus tessellation only. (A2) Six years later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (white arrows) developed. (B) Fundus photographs from a 64-year-old Chinese woman showing development of incident MMD (development of patchy chorioretinal atrophy) over a follow-up of 6 years. (B1) Image from the left eye obtained at baseline visit (SE of –10.3 D and AL of 27.8 mm) showing fundus tessellation only. (B2) Six years later, several well-defined patchy chorioretinal atrophies (black arrows) in the macular region and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) developed at the fovea.",

(A1) Image from the right eye obtained at baseline visit (SE of –2.8 D and AL of 28.4 mm) showing diffuse chorioretinal atrophy on the inferior–temporal region of the macula. (A2) Six years later, several spotted patchy chorioretinal atrophies (white arrows) and lacquer cracks (white arrowheads) developed, and the preexisting diffuse chorioretinal atrophy expanded. Enlargement of PPA was observed as well. (B) Fundus photographs from a 50-year-old Malay man showing MMD progression with development of new patchy chorioretinal atrophy over a follow-up of 6 years. (B1) Image from the right eye obtained at baseline visit (SE of –12.3 D) showing diffuse chorioretinal atrophy on the entire macular region and Fuchs’ spot at the fovea. (B2) Six years later, a small new patchy chorioretinal atrophy (black arrow) developed in the macular region near the Fuchs’ spot. Enlargement of the PPA was seen.",

(B1) Image from the left eye obtained at baseline visit (SE of –14.4 D and AL of 28.0 mm) showing several patchy chorioretinal atrophies temporal to macular (white arrows). (B2) Six years later, the fundus showed an enlargement of the patchy chorioretinal atrophy coalescing with other previous patchy chorioretinal atrophies (black arrows) toward the macula, but not involving macula. Enlargement of the PPA was seen as well. (C) Fundus photographs from a 45-year-old Chinese man showing progression of MMD (enlargement of both diffuse and patchy chorioretinal atrophy) over a follow-up of 6 years. (C1) Image from the right eye obtained at baseline visit (SE of –15.6 D and AL of 33.1 mm) showing multiple small pigmented patchy chorioretinal atrophies (white arrows) around the macula. (C2) Six years later, the fundus showed slight enlargement of the patchy chorioretinal atrophies (black arrows) around the macula and enlargement of the diffuse chorioretinal atrophy inferior to the macula (white arrowheads). Enlargement of the PPA was observed.",
