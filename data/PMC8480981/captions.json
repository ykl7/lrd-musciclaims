  "figure_3": "(A–C) Dot plots comparing variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of the mutations identified in the AITL and the concomitant hematologic malignancies. Red dots show the variants shared between different hematologic neoplasms or entity in the same patient. Dark blue dots in (A) indicate the variants specially related to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and the black dots in (A) denote the AITL-specific variants. Schematic diagrams depicting hypothetical clonal evolution models of the tumors deriving from mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are also presented. In patient #5 (A), additional mutations besides the clonal hematopoiesis (CH)-associated mutations were identified and implicated in the disease progression to AITL and CMML, respectively. In patient #20, no additional mutations besides those mutated in HSC are identified. In patient #14, a mutated EZH2, indicated by green dot, is implicated in the progression to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In all three cases, there are mutations that are shared between the AITL and the concomitant myeloid or B lymphomas, supporting evolution of these neoplasms from a common precursor. PV: polycythemia vena; post-PV PMF, post-PV primary myelofibrosis; ITP: immune thrombocytopenia.",
  "figure_4": "Kaplan–Meier analysis of concomitant hematologic neoplasm-free survival in AITL or AITL-related patients based on TET2 mutation status in the BM/PB. Concomitant hematologic neoplasm-free survival of AITL patients can be stratified based on absent/low or high TET2 mutation burden subgroups. p-Value was calculated by log-rank test, and p-value<0.05 is considered statistically significant. In one case, the second hematologic malignancy (PV) preceded the development of AITL."
