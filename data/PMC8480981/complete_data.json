Schematic diagrams depicting hypothetical clonal evolution models of the tumors deriving from mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are also presented. In patient #5 (A), additional mutations besides the clonal hematopoiesis (CH)-associated mutations were identified and implicated in the disease progression to AITL and CMML, respectively. In patient #20, no additional mutations besides those mutated in HSC are identified. In patient #14, a mutated EZH2, indicated by green dot, is implicated in the progression to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In all three cases, there are mutations that are shared between the AITL and the concomitant myeloid or B lymphomas, supporting evolution of these neoplasms from a common precursor.
