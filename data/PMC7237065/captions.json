  "figure_5": "Universal patient pathway for breast cancer management in three sequential intervals of care (Patient Interval, Diagnostic Interval, and Treatment Interval) highlighting the Patient and Diagnostic Intervals of care. The Patient Interval begins with the onset of clinical symptoms or an abnormal screening exam and extends to the time the patient presents for diagnostic work-up of a recognized or suspected breast abnormality. During the Diagnostic Interval, the identified breast abnormality undergoes a ‘triple test’ work-up based on clinical evaluation, imaging and tissue sampling to achieve a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis. The health system should endeavor to complete the diagnostic work-up within a 60 day (2 month) period, because worsened survival outcomes can result from diagnostic delays extending significantly beyond 3 months."
