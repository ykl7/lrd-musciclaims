From each of these 20 tissue sections were obtained for analysis. Segment 1 always represents the superior portion of the eye, whereas segment 10 always represents the nasal portion. Here, a left eye is depicted. In right eyes the nasal quadrant is located on the opposite side and segments would be numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion. (B) Radial section of the TM of a normal human eye displaying mildly reduced TM cellularity. Arrow indicates TM cell nuclei, whereas the arrowhead indicates pigmented debris. The outlined area denotes the analyzed region. TM= sclera, CL=corneal limbus, IR=iris, SC=Schlemm’s Canal, Scalebar = 50 μm",
