  "figure_1": "Schematic representation of the dissection scheme used in this study. The donor eyes were divided into twelve equivalent segments (1–12). From each of these 20 tissue sections were obtained for analysis. Segment 1 always represents the superior portion of the eye, whereas segment 10 always represents the nasal portion. Here, a left eye is depicted. In right eyes the nasal quadrant is located on the opposite side and segments would be numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion. (B) Radial section of the TM of a normal human eye displaying mildly reduced TM cellularity. Arrow indicates TM cell nuclei, whereas the arrowhead indicates pigmented debris. The outlined area denotes the analyzed region. TM= sclera, CL=corneal limbus, IR=iris, SC=Schlemm’s Canal, Scalebar = 50 μm",
  "figure_2": "Cellularity in each segment of the study eyes. A, B, C: Normal eyes, D, E, F: POAG eyes. Values are given as cells/100 μm. Section measurements are represented by dots. The height of the bar represents their average. Error bars denote standard deviation.",
  "figure_3": "Normalized cellularity of (A) normal and (B) POAG eyes. The height of each bar reflects the proportional difference in cellularity of the segment relative to the overall cell density average of the eye.",
  "figure_4": "(A) TM cell density (cells/100 μm) in the six examined eyes correlated with the highest IOP clinically observed in the donor (R2=0.91).",
  "figure_5": "Cell number variability in normal (n=11) and glaucomatous (n=6) segmental regions. (A) En face fluorescence images identifying high (HF), intermediate (MF), and low flow (LF) regions of the TM following perfusion with fluorescent microbeads in a single human donor eye. (B) Average number of DAPI-stained nuclei in segmental flow regions from normal (“Norm”) and glaucomatous (“Gl”) eyes. A statistically significant reduction of cellularity is observed when the same flow regions are compared between normal to glaucomatous tissues. “*” p = 0.030, “**” p = 0.015, “***” p = 0.009 (ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test)."
