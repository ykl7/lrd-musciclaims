  "figure_1": "A single small hyperTD (white arrow) is detected on the baseline en face OCT (A). The corresponding horizontal OCT B-scan (E) shows choroidal hypertransmission and a small region of RPE disruption, but no overlying photoreceptor degeneration (white asterisk). The criteria for iRORA are not met at baseline on OCT. Fourteen months from baseline, multiple small hyperTDs (white circle) are evident with a progression to iRORA (B and F). Six months later (20 months from baseline), these small hyperTDs coalesced and developed into large hyperTDs with a hyporeflective core (donut; yellow arrow) on the en face OCT (C) and iRORA (yellow asterisk) on the corresponding B-scan (G). At the final follow-up (26 months from baseline), a large hyperTD without a hyporeflective core (yellow arrow) is evident on the en face OCT (D) with cRORA (yellow asterisk) on the corresponding B-scan (H). This eye is deemed a progression eye.",
  "figure_2": "Three medium hyperTDs (white arrows) are detected at baseline on the en face OCT (A). None of the hyperTD lesions meet the criteria for iRORA and one of the lesions shows in B. At the follow-up visit, two of the baseline hyperTDs persisted (yellow arrows) on the en face OCT (C). Two new hyperTDs (yellow sharp and yellow asterisk) are also noted on the en face OCT (C) with iRORA (yellow sharp and yellow asterisk) on the B-scan (D). This eye is deemed a progression eye."
