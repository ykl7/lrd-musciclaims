  "figure_1": "Age at initial diagnosis of myeloid malignancies for select diagnostic entities. Most patients with germline predisposition syndromes will develop myeloid malignancies at a younger age than patients with sporadic MDS or AML. However, patients with germline mutations in ANKRD26, DDX41, or ETV6 develop myeloid malignancies within an age range that significantly overlaps with sporadic MDS and AML. Select entities such as myeloid neoplasms with germline TP53 mutation are not shown, because age of incidence is variable and often depends on patient history including treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation. Myeloid malignancies associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia are too few in number to estimate an age distribution.",
  "figure_2": "(A) Schematic of the CEBPA gene showing features including dual transactivation domains (TADs), DNA binding domain (DBD), the C-terminal bZIP region, and alternative internal translation start site (ATG p30). The N-terminal region harbors most germline mutations whereas acquired mutations typically occur near the C-terminus. (B) Schematic of the DDX41 gene showing features including the DEAD box domain and a C-terminal helicase (HELICc) domain. The region affected by germline mutations is shared by acquired mutations, but germline mutations tend to be frameshift and missense mutations whereas acquired mutations are more frequently splice site and missense mutations. The common R525H acquired mutation is highlighted. aa = amino acid, nt = nucleotide.",
  "figure_3": "(A) Low-power hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and (B) high-power Wright-stained images of bone marrow from a patient with germline RUNX1 mutation, showing a hypocellular marrow and small hypolobated megakaryocytes. (C) H&E and (D) Wright-stained images of bone marrow megakaryocytes from a patient with germline ANKRD26 mutation, showing small hypolobated megakaryocytes. (E) Schematic of the ANKRD26 gene highlighting ankyrin repeat (AR), coiled-coil domains and 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR). Germline mutations in ANKRD26 typically occur in the 5’ UTR where they are hypothesized to impact binding of regulatory factors such as RUNX1 and FLI1. A germline D158G coding mutation has also been recently reported. aa = amino acid, nt = nucleotide. Red letters reflect reported sites of germline mutations. (F) H&E and (G) Wright-stained images of bone marrow megakaryocytes from a patient with germline GATA2 mutation, showing characteristic multiple small separate nuclei.",
  "figure_4": "Suggested workflow for the identification and triage of new myeloid malignancy diagnoses and potential referral for germline testing. (Level 1) Patients who already have a suspected germline predisposition syndrome should always undergo further evaluation. (Level 2) Select diagnoses (sometimes based on age at presentation) which are highly enriched for individuals with germline syndromes should also be referred for germline evaluation. (Level 3) In patients with MDS or AML, additional information should be sought to determine whether they may benefit from germline evaluation. (Level 4) Finally, select mutations should trigger a recommendation for germline evaluation, even when identified in isolation. (Level 5) Patients who fail to meet any of these criteria should continue to be re-evaluated throughout their clinical course. See Supplementary Figure 4 legend for additional details and rationale."
