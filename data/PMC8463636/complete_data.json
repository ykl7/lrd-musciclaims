Rates are age-adjusted 5-year averages. Rates for 44 states are for Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Six states (DE, IL, KS, KY, MA, and PA) did not have such rates available, and rates for Whites including Hispanics (WIH) were used. Alaska and Hawaii (not shown) have rates of 7.2 and 7.3, and both have 0 research reactors",
