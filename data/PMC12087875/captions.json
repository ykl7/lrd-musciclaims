  "figure_1": "Scatter plots of lens power Pl as a function of corneal power Pc in emmetropic eyes using (a) the original parameter values and (b) values scaled according to AL. Colour gradient represents AL. AL, axial length. AU, arbitrary units.",
  "figure_2": "While the average values of many biometric parameters are significantly different between refractive groups, there is still considerable overlap. This is illustrated for (a) corneal power Pc, (b) lens power Pl, (c) anterior chamber depth ACDtot and (d) AL. Black marks indicate the average for each refractive bin and error bars the 95% confidence interval of the standard error. Small vertical variations in the position of each point were added to illustrate the number of individual eyes in each group. ACD, aqueous depth; AL, axial length.",
  "figure_3": "Top: Layout of the average eye based on the entire population, with the lens radii of curvature estimated using Royston's equations\n45\n (not used in calculations, only for visualisation). Bottom: Positions of the refractive surfaces and ocular and corneal focal points for all eyes (black) and emmetropic eyes (red), sorted based on axial length. The anterior cornea is located at x = 0 mm, and the diagonal line at 20–29 mm represents the position of the retina.",
  "figure_4": "Positions of the refractive surfaces and the ocular and corneal focal points, sorted according to axial length, for three levels of refractive error. The anterior cornea is located at x = 0 mm. The red dashed line represents the average axial length and the diagonal line the retina. For the full range, see the animation in Figure S4.",
  "figure_5": "Linear regressions of the ocular biometry parameters as a function of axial length considered for the refractive groups. (a) Corneal power and (b) lens power. Other examples in Figure S5.",
  "figure_6": "(a–d) Four examples of multivariate bigaussian fits of the ocular biometry, dividing the population into the Regulated (red) and Dysregulated (black) subgroups (more examples available in Figure S6). Ellipses represent the 97.62% confidence region for each subgroup as explained in the text. Vectors indicate the eigenvectors for each subgroup. Although these eigenvectors are perpendicular, this may not be apparent due to scale differences on the horizontal and vertical axes. (e) Scatter plot of Regulated and Dysregulated eyes. (f) Bigaussian fit of the refractive distribution.",
  "figure_7": "(a) Position of the refractive surfaces scaled to AL in all emmetropic eyes, with the anterior cornea at 0%. (b) Relative contributions to the total refractive power of the eye of the cornea (Pc/Peye) and the lens (Pl/Peye), both calculated at the ocular principal planes. Dashed lines indicate the reference in the case of proportional scaling of a 23.5‐mm eye, while retaining the same refractive contributions by the cornea and lens. AL, axial length.",
  "figure_8": "Axial length (AL) to corneal radius (CR) of curvature ratio as a function of refractive error. Emmetropic eyes are indicated by the dark grey markers. SE, spherical equivalent.",
  "figure_9": "(a) Axial length (AL) plotted as a function of the spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error in bins of 0.5 D. (b) SE plotted as function of AL in bins of 0.25 mm. (c, d) As for (a, b), fitted with bigaussian ellipses representing the Regulated and Dysregulated subgroups."
