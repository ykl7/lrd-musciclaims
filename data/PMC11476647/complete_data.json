      "caption": "Schematic representation of the Nrf2/Keap1/ARE signaling pathway. (A) During normal homeostasis, Nrf2 binds to Keap1 by DLG (low affinity) and ETGE (high affinity) motifs forming a homodimer, and activates Cul3-mediated ubiquitination in the lysine-rich region followed by proteasomal degradation. Under oxidative stress or xenobiotic exposure disulfide bonds form within Keap1, modifying IVR conformation and disrupting Kelch-DLG/ETGE binding. In absence of ubiquitination, increased amount of Nrf2 protein accumulates and translocates into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, Nrf2 forms a heterodimer with sMaf protein and subsequently binds to ARE, to trigger the transcription of downstream genes. ARE-regulated mRNA transcripts are translated with SelCys tRNA, which is directly regulated by Brf2 activity. Oxidative stress inhibits Brf2 from producing SeCys tRNA, functionally providing negative feedback on oxidative-induced antioxidant responses. (B) Healthy cells and cancer stem cells act differently when exposed to high and low levels of Nrf2 agonism. At low doses of xenobiotic exposure, Nrf2 stimulation increases cytoprotection/neuroprotection in healthy cells and enhances chemoresistance in cancer cells. High-dose xenobiotic exposure or ROS burden in healthy cells inhibits Brf2 activity, allowing for cytotoxicity and regulated cell death. In cancer cells high-dose xenobiotic exposure enhances chemoresistance due to cancer-specific Brf2-overexpression. Nrf2 antagonism in both health/cancerous tissue increases oxidative burden, enhancing apoptosis/ferroptosis. In cancerous cells Nrf2 antagonism helps regain chemosensitivity, inhibiting cancer-specific mechanisms which suppress chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. (C) Regulation of Nrf2-associated activities with regard to cancer. Epigenetic alterations lead to transcriptional enhancements in Nrf2 levels. Methylation of Keap1 transcriptionally reduces Keap1 levels. Exon skipping of Nrf2 and somatic mutations in either of Nrf2, Keap1, and Cul3 disrupt Nrf2/Keap1 interactions. Modifications in Keap1 cysteine-residues and Keap1‐ competing protein e.g. p62 lead to the reduced binding affinity between Nrf2‐Keap1, and antagonize ubiquitination of Nrf2. Downstream activities of Nrf2 cascade include maintenance and/or regulation of cellular redox homeostasis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Generation of NADPH, and pentose synthesis is controlled by Nrf2 downstream genes. Products of lipid metabolism serve as important biomarkers regarding cancer progression. In addition, Nrf2 promotes expression of genes involved in drug metabolism, thus playing vital role in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
