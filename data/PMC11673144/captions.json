  "figure_2": "Mechanisms of brain cancer-related hypercoagulability. The tumor-induced upregulation of procoagulant factors, combined with the downregulation of natural anticoagulant mechanisms, facilitates thrombus formation. Key molecular pathways involved include cytokine-driven blood sludging, the upregulation of tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, mucin secretion, and the inhibition of protein C and thrombomodulin. These processes collectively contribute to a hypercoagulable state in brain cancer.",
  "figure_3": "Inflammatory and immunological pathways in brain cancer-related stroke. This figure illustrates the inflammatory and immunological pathways that contribute to the establishment of a neurotoxic microenvironment (NTME) in brain cancer, thereby increasing stroke risk. It highlights the roles of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in promoting cerebrovascular damage. The diagram also emphasizes how these interconnected processes exacerbate stroke severity and identifies potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Abbreviations: ROS—Reactive oxygen species; RNS—Reactive nitrogen species; BBB—Blood-brain barrier."
