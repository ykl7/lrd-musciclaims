The tumor-induced upregulation of procoagulant factors, combined with the downregulation of natural anticoagulant mechanisms, facilitates thrombus formation. Key molecular pathways involved include cytokine-driven blood sludging, the upregulation of tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, mucin secretion, and the inhibition of protein C and thrombomodulin. These processes collectively contribute to a hypercoagulable state in brain cancer.",
