  "figure_1": "Rotationally symmetric schematic eyes used for paraxial retinal magnification factor calculations with all ocular media assumed homogenous. The angles of the incident rays, in red, have been exaggerated for ease of visualization. The cyan surfaces and distances are estimated using ocular biometry. In Li’s schematic eye, the posterior corneal surface (yellow) has a radius proportional to that of the anterior surface (blue).",
