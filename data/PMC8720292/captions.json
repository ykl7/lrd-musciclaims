  "figure_1": "Nanoparticles must overcome multiple barriers for effective gene therapy to the brain. Particles may be administered systemically, after which stability in circulation and extravasation past the BBB into the brain must be optimized, or locally directly at the tumor site in the brain. Once in the brain, nanoparticles must distribute sufficiently throughout the tumor tissue and be taken up by target cells, which may be either tumor cells or surrounding cell types that contribute to tumor growth. This targeting may be accomplished by transfecting tumor-homing cells or by functionalizing the nanoparticles with ligands for receptors on the target cells.",
