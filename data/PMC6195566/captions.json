  "figure_2": "Tracer-decorated human aqueous outflow pattern. Frontal sections of anterior segments showing tracer distribution in (A) vehicle control, (B) SB77 (50 µM) treated eyes. Tracer distribution was more uniform, intense and widely spread all over the meshwork and also in the inner wall of SC in SB77-treated eyes as compared to vehicle-treated eyes. (C) Measurement of TM thickness in tracer decorated region. A marginal 11.2% increase in TM thickness was observed in SB77-treated eyes as compared to vehicle-treated eyes (SB77-treated eyes: 129.29 ± 14.3 µm, vehicle control eyes: 116.09 ± 16.7 µm; n = 3; p = 0.354; unpaired t-test). TM-Trabecular meshwork; SC-Schlemm’s canal and S-Sclera.",
  "figure_3": "Effect of SB77 on HTM cell viability by MTT assay. (A) HTM cells treated with SB77 showed more than 85% (Mean percentage viability: 87.8 ± 5.9) cell viability at the studied concentrations (0.1–100 µM). The values are represented as mean ± SD. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. (B) Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) - mediated fluroscein-16-dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) staining on HTM cells after treatment with DNAse I (i), vehicle control (ii), SB77 (iii) and Y27632 (iv) for 24 h. TUNEL positive cells (green) were detected only in HTM cells treated with DNase I (i) (Positive control). No TUNEL positive cells were detected in other treatment groups. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). A detailed protocol for MTT and TUNEL assay was given in method section.",
  "figure_4": "Effect of SB77 on TM actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion (vimentin) and ECM (fibronectin). (A) Treatment with SB77 caused decreased positive staining of stress fibers, vimentin, vinculin, fibronectin and collagen 1 A staining. HTM cells treated with Y27632 showed similar findings; however, the observed effect was more prominent in SB77-treated cells as compared to Y27632-treated cells. The images are representative of three independent experiments. Green fluorescence indicates positivity for F-actin, vimentin, vinculin, fibronectin and collagen 1 A. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). (B) Immunoblot analysis showing the effect of SB77 on the expression of focal adhesion and ECM protein. Decreased expression of vinculin, vimentin and ECM proteins was observed in HTM cells treated with both inhibitors. Treatment with SB77 showed a marked decrease as compared to vehicle control and Y27632-treated cells. The cropped images are used in the figure, and full length blots for the same are presented in S. Fig. 3. (C) Densitometry analysis of the results of 4B. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001; ***p < 0.0001, paired Student’s t-test.",
  "figure_5": "Effect of SB77 or Y27632 on activation of RhoA. (A) Both SB77 and Y27632 at 50 µM dose inhibited the activation of RhoA in HTM cells. The amount of reduction in activated RhoA was determined by a pull-down assay. Data shown in upper and lower panels were results of an immunoblot analysis against GTP-binding Rho (GTP-Rho) and total RhoA. The cropped blots are used in the figure and full length blots for the total RhoA and active RhoA are given in S. Fig. 4. (B) Densitometry of Western blots of active RhoA normalized to total RhoA. Both Rho kinase inhibitors significantly inhibited the activation of RhoA. Total RhoA was unaffected by the treatment. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05 (Treated vs Control); paired Student’s t-test. (C) Representative immunofluorescence analysis showing reduced staining of p-MLC (green) after treatment with SB77. The observed effect was very prominent as compared to Y27632 and vehicle control groups. Cell nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue).",
  "figure_6": "Effect of SB77 on mRNA expression of fibrotic markers by quantitative RT-PCR. A significant reduction in mRNA levels of Fibronectin (p = 0.005), COL1A1 (p = 0.015), α-SMA (p = 0.038) and FSP-1(p = 0.019) compared to vehicle control was achieved with SB77 treatment. Y27632 treatment also showed similar fold changes, except for the larger change in COL4A1. β-catenin mRNA levels were reduced significantly in SB77- treated cells as compared to vehicle controls (p = 0.000) but it was not found to be significant when compared with Y27632-treated cells (p = 0.088), whereas COL4A1 was significantly reduced in Y27632 treated cells as compared to vehicle-treated cells (p = 0.001). The fold change in gene expression was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method, with GAPDH as a house-keeping gene. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001; ***p < 0.0001(n = 3); Treated (SB77 or Y27632) vs vehicle control group, paired Student’s t-test.",
  "figure_7": "Schematic illustration of the effect of SB77 on IOP in HOCAS. Rho kinase is reported to mediate smooth muscle contraction by phosphorylating the myosin-light chain (MLC) directly and by decreasing myosin phosphatase activity indirectly, resulting in increased actin fiber formation and high intraocular pressure. SB77, a new Rho kinase inhibitor enhanced outflow facility in human eyes. This could be due to cellular relaxation of the TM mediated through inhibition of Rho kinase. This results in decreased p-MLC, altered cytoskeletal rearrangement and reduced fibrotic markers."
