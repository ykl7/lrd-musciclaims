Hypoxia regulates IFN-γ secretion in NK cells. Furthermore, HIF-1α-induced autophagy promotes the degradation of GZMB. b) Glucose, as the primary energy source for NK cells, is critical for the function of these cells. The upregulation of GLUT1/2/3 and TNFα-TNFR2 signaling facilitates glucose uptake, promoting glycolysis and enhancing the antitumor activity of NK cells. c) Lactate production in the TME is tightly coupled with LDHB activity. MCT4 mediates lactate export from tumor cells, whereas MCT1 can reverse the acidic microenvironment. This modulation ultimately augments NKp46 expression and NK cell functionality. d) The hypoxic microenvironment, glycolytic metabolism of tumor cells, and excretion of lactate within breast cancer tumors considerably affect the mitochondrial homeostasis of NK cells. This disruption leads to mitochondrial shrinkage and fragmentation, compromising the antitumor efficacy of NK cells.",

Senescent CAFs secrete ECM components that selectively undermine the cytotoxicity of NK cells. The targeted deletion of DKK1 in CAFs restores NK cell activation and tumoricidal capacity. ECM- and TGF-β-myCAFs downregulate PERF and GZMB expression while upregulating NKG2A. Notably, DPP4 and yes-associated protein 1 drive the differentiation of CAFs toward the ECM-myCAF phenotype. b) Adipocytes suppress the lytic capacity and degranulation of NK cells by releasing immunosuppressive factors, such as leptin, IL-6, and IDO-1. c) MSCs hinder the secretion of PERF and GZMB. Remarkably, adipose-derived MSCs impart immunosuppressive effects by transferring lipids to NK cells via exosome vesicles. However, MSCs overexpressing SIRT1 can augment the antitumor capabilities of NK cells through the release of CXCL10 and IFN-γ.",
