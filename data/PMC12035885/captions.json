  "figure_2": "Crucial environmental factors associated with NK cell function in the TME of breast cancer. a) Hypoxia modulates epigenetics through the HDAC1/PRC2 axis, thereby influencing the NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways. Hypoxia regulates IFN-γ secretion in NK cells. Furthermore, HIF-1α-induced autophagy promotes the degradation of GZMB. b) Glucose, as the primary energy source for NK cells, is critical for the function of these cells. The upregulation of GLUT1/2/3 and TNFα-TNFR2 signaling facilitates glucose uptake, promoting glycolysis and enhancing the antitumor activity of NK cells. c) Lactate production in the TME is tightly coupled with LDHB activity. MCT4 mediates lactate export from tumor cells, whereas MCT1 can reverse the acidic microenvironment. This modulation ultimately augments NKp46 expression and NK cell functionality. d) The hypoxic microenvironment, glycolytic metabolism of tumor cells, and excretion of lactate within breast cancer tumors considerably affect the mitochondrial homeostasis of NK cells. This disruption leads to mitochondrial shrinkage and fragmentation, compromising the antitumor efficacy of NK cells.",
  "figure_3": "Main metabolites in the TME of breast cancer that affect NK cell function. a) IDO catalyzes the degradation of Trp into L-Kyn, subsequently downregulating the expression of the NK cell activation receptors NKG2D and NKp46. Additionally, IDO upregulates HLA-G expression, thereby diminishing NK cell functionality. b) In DNA-damaged tumor cells, uric acid activates the TAK1/NF-κB/ERK signaling pathway, ultimately resulting in the upregulation of NKG2D ligands (MICA/B) and enhancement of antitumor immune responses. c) ADO exerts immunosuppressive effects by engaging ADO receptors on NK cells. d) Disruptions in serine-sphingomyelin metabolism hinder synapse formation on NK cell membranes, compromising the tumor cell recognition and elimination capabilities of NK cells.",
  "figure_4": "Key stromal components within the breast cancer TME regulate NK cell functionality. a) The PDPN-positive CAF subset impairs ADCC via the release of immunosuppressive enzymes, specifically IDO-1 and TDO-2. Senescent CAFs secrete ECM components that selectively undermine the cytotoxicity of NK cells. The targeted deletion of DKK1 in CAFs restores NK cell activation and tumoricidal capacity. ECM- and TGF-β-myCAFs downregulate PERF and GZMB expression while upregulating NKG2A. Notably, DPP4 and yes-associated protein 1 drive the differentiation of CAFs toward the ECM-myCAF phenotype. b) Adipocytes suppress the lytic capacity and degranulation of NK cells by releasing immunosuppressive factors, such as leptin, IL-6, and IDO-1. c) MSCs hinder the secretion of PERF and GZMB. Remarkably, adipose-derived MSCs impart immunosuppressive effects by transferring lipids to NK cells via exosome vesicles. However, MSCs overexpressing SIRT1 can augment the antitumor capabilities of NK cells through the release of CXCL10 and IFN-γ.",
  "figure_5": "Immune-activating and -inhibiting cells in the breast cancer TME that affect NK cell function. a) TILs, which are represented by CD8+ T cells, and NK cells exert their respective antitumor effects. Meanwhile, CD8+ T cells can enhance the function of NK cells through cytokines, such as type I IFNs, TNF-α, and IL12. NKp44+ NK cells can also affect the clonality of CD8+ T cells. b) DCs enhance NK cell function by releasing IFN-γ and TNF-α and regulating the TLR7/mROS/IL12 axis. c) CXCR4-positive and SRC-overexpressing Tregs inhibit the activation of NK cells and release of GZMB and CD107a. d) MDSCs inhibit the killing ability of NK cells through mechanisms, such as nitric oxide production. e) TAMs could inhibit the activation of CD69+ NK cells and TGF-β-mediated maturation of CD27-CD11b+ NK cells.",
