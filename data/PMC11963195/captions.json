  "figure_1": "The skin has three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The epidermal layer is further divided into five sub-layers. The dermis and hypodermis layer contain blood vessels.",
  "figure_2": "The major types of skin cancer are melanoma skin cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer. Non-melanoma skin cancer includes basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These types affect different skin cells in different skin layers and demonstrate how cancerous cells infiltrate blood vessels, leading to additional malignancy.",
  "figure_3": "Melanoma skin cancer develops from melanocytes and spreads in the epidermis and dermis. UV: Ultraviolet.",
  "figure_4": "The four major forms of melanoma skin cancer are superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, lentigo melanoma, and acral lentiginous melanoma.",
  "figure_5": "Melanoma has five stages. These are stage 0, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4.",
  "figure_6": "Basal cell carcinoma develops from the basal cell layer of the epidermis of the skin and appears as a small bump on the skin. NMSCs: Non-melanoma skin cancers.",
  "figure_7": "Squamous cell carcinoma originates from epidermal keratinocytes or squamous cells of the top layer of the skin, which appears as a smooth, firm, or hyperkeratotic plaque or papule, usually with central ulceration.116 NMSCs: Non-melanoma skin cancers; UV: Ultraviolet."
