  "figure_1": "Alignment of parts of the transmembrane domain VII and the cytosolic helix VIII of selected opsin sequences showing the conserved lysine 296 (K296) chromophore binding site and other motifs important for opsin-G protein interaction like NPXXY and the tripeptide. The tripeptide and the NPXXY motif are strongly modified in several flatworm xenopsin B sequences (highlighted in red), but are conserved in M. fuliginosus and T. inopinata xenopsin (highlighted in blue).",

  "figure_7": "The bilaterian ancestor had extraocular c-opsin+ ciliary PRCs. These became integrated into the eyes in the lineage leading to vertebrates and were lost in many protostomes along with secondary loss of c-opsin. Scenario A: Cerebral eyes contained microvillar r-opsin+ PRCs in the bilaterian ancestor. Xenopsin was co-opted several times independently by microvillar PRCs, and eye PRCs were several times independently transformed into or replaced by ciliary xenopsin+ PRCs. Scenario B: Ancestral r-opsin+ microvillar eye PRCs were transformed once into mixed microvillar/ciliary PRCs coexpressing r-opsin and xenopsin. In extant organisms, those were retained or changed into purely microvillar r-opsin+ or ciliary xenopsin+ PRCs going along with genomic loss or downregulation of xenopsin or r-opsin, respectively. Scenario C: Mixed ciliary/microvillar PRCs were already present in the bilaterian ancestor."
