Ten-year risks were calculated from the absolute risks of developing breast cancer or prostate cancer (Figure 1). (A) The 10-year risks of developing breast cancer for BRCA2 carriers by PRSER+ percentiles. (B) The 10-year risks of developing prostate cancer for BRCA1 pathogenic variant carriers by PRSPC percentiles. (C) The 10-year risks of developing prostate cancer for BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers by PRSPC percentiles. PRS = polygenic risk scores PRSER+ = ER-positive breast cancer PRS."
