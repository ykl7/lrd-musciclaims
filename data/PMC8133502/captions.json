  "figure_1": "Waddington's epigenetic landscape depicts the process of development as balls rolling down a hill that tend toward more stable phenotypes (represented by valleys or “canals”). Waddington's epigenetic landscape depicts cell fate (differentiation) trajectories as balls rolling down a rugged landscape. The likelihood of a cell adopting a given state is represented by the elevation or depression of the landscape, that is, a likely, stable cellular state (as determined by its gene expression profile) is depicted as a valley and unlikely states are represented by elevated hilltops. More recently, mathematical modeling of transcriptional dynamics has, in part, provided the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenomenon of canalization. For a cell to change its phenotype, the cell must transition from an original phenotype that is evolutionarily adaptive (and, therefore, very stable, e.g., attractor state 1) to a new stable phenotype (e.g., attractor state 2). This transformation is driven by the gene regulatory network (GRN), or the overarching architecture between all gene products that orchestrates gene expression profiles and, in turn, determines the final cellular “state” or phenotype. While a given cell can adopt different states along its differentiation trajectory, it can also undergo a state transition or exhibit plasticity between states at a given time point in its development.",
  "figure_2": "Clonal evolution can be visualized as a fitness landscape, in which individual somatic mutations are minor deviations in genotypic space toward a local fitness optimum. The fitness, or propensity of an individual clone to successfully divide into daughter cells, is depicted here in reduced dimension as a three-dimensional fitness landscape, first described by Sewall Wright in 1931 (113). A mutation causes an individual cell to travel across genotypic space (depicted as the x,y-axes), which can impact fitness (depicted as the z-axis). Certain combinations of mutations may result in greater fitness and subsequent clonal expansion, represented as an upward inflection on the z-axis, that is, a hilltop. An actively adapting population will climb uphill by a sequence of minute genetic changes until a local optimum is achieved. Clonal expansion may occur if evolution slows as these optimums are reached, that is, conditions stabilize. Of note, this convention is the opposite of Waddington's epigenetic landscape, in which more favored states are depicted as valleys rather than hilltops.",
  "figure_3": "Dynamic selective pressures imposed by the microenvironment with aging and disease pathogenesis result in differential expansion of clones. In early life, immune surveillance results in purifying selection and effective removal of (pre-)malignant clones, thereby preventing their expansion and, in turn, detection. Immune clearance of malignant cells evidently declines with age in the phenomenon known as immunosenescence, in part, providing an explanation for the greater incidences of myeloid malignancies in the elderly (114). For a number of reasons, including thymic involution and increasing ratios of regulatory T cells to cytotoxic T cells, (pre-)malignant cells expressing neoantigens that would otherwise be eliminated by immune surveillance are permitted to persist and expand in old age (114,115,116,117,118). Later in life, the increasing selective pressure of inflammaging can lead to clonal expansions and clonal hematopoiesis. Finally, in leukemia, malignant clones are selected for and completely consume the bone marrow, leading to symptomatic consequences. The upper range depicted in red represents the threshold at which the buffering by remaining healthy hematopoietic clones is no longer sufficient to achieve a canalized healthy phenotype and clinical symptoms emerge. The lower range depicted in dark peach represents the sequencing limit of detection. The green represents phenotypically wild-type clones, while the other colors represent (pre-)malignant clones with pathogenic mutation(s). In the aging microenvironment, the wild-type clones retain enough of a selective advantage to sustain hematopoiesis and prevent any clinical consequences; however, upon progression to leukemia, the bone marrow microenvironment has been remodeled to favor mutated clones over wild-type (green). The wild-type clones can no longer sustain healthy hematopoiesis, and the patient will present with symptoms of leukemia.",
  "figure_4": "Fitness landscapes are themselves dynamic and can change in the context of a healthy versus aberrant microenvironment. In the healthy microenvironmental context (left), the nonmutated, wild-type clone exhibits the greatest fitness advantage as compared with TP53-mutated clones with mono- and biallelic loss-of-function mutations. The endogenous bone marrow microenvironment favors wild-type clones as an evolutionary mechanism to maintain intact hematopoiesis, a feature essential for viable life during reproductive years. In contrast, an anemic microenvironment (right) may sustain aberrant growth signals in an effort to boost erythropoiesis, perhaps providing a selective advantage to the more proliferative TP53-mutated clones. WT, wild-type.",
  "figure_5": "Addition of a defector clone (CD) results in decline of fitness of a malignant clone (CM) but stable coexistence with a benign clone (CB). With aging and various other insults, the leukemic microenvironment is transformed, no longer resembling the greater tissue architecture of healthy bone marrow. In the absence of therapy, this aberrant microenvironment may possess growth signals and disrupted tissue organization such that a malignant clone bears a fitness advantage (left). Upon administration of cellular therapy, a defector cell enters the fitness landscape, depleting microenvironmental nutrients critical for sustaining the highly proliferative malignant clone, and, thereby, altering the entire fitness landscape (right). The outcome of this therapy is a stable coexistence of defector cells and benign clones capable of sustaining hematopoiesis. Of note, this depiction differs slightly from previous figures and Wright's classic fitness landscape, as clones are more loosely defined as traveling across phenotypic space, which encompasses both genetic and nongenetic (including transcriptional and epigenetic) components. Within a given population of genetically identical (clonal) cells, there exists subpopulations of cells exhibiting varying transcriptional states that will contribute to clonal evolution and ultimately dictate phenotype."
