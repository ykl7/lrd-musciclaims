  "figure_1": "Oxidative stress and redox pathway in normal (above) and cancer cells (below). ROS regulate several signaling events by regulating the transcriptions of different genes in a hypoxic microenvironment that regulate the cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. ROS endorse lipid peroxidation, promote electron leakage, and trigger Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. ROS in moderate concentrations activate oncogenes and suppress tumor suppressor genes that in turn increase ROS concentration. Intracellular free Ca2+ triggers PKC activation that promotes proliferation. OS also endorses antioxidant genes, promotes angiogenesis, and triggers DNA mutation. In addition, ROS induce HDACs that activate oncogenes and inhibit tumor suppressor genes through epigenetic regulation. Red arrows indicate downstream events and red lines indicate inhibition.

  "figure_2": "Oxidative stress-related biomarkers in the brain. The mitochondrion is considered to be the major intracellular production house of ROS. Several enzymes, such as NOX, XO, and uncoupled form of NOS can trigger O2•− production. NOS also catalyze the metabolic reaction of amino acid to produce NO. NO reacts with O2•− and produces ONOO•−, a RNS. O2•− is converted into H2O2 by the action of SOD, which subsequently produces OH•−. H2O2 also yields HOCl by the action of MPO, which again yields O2•− and highly active Cl−. These highly active free radicals deplete GSH and endorse oxidative damages to cellular lipids, proteins, and DNA, resulting in aberrant levels of some specific biochemical markers in the blood circulation. Thus, these specific biochemical markers could serve as potential OS-related biomarkers.

  "figure_4": "Differential response of ascorbate at a pharmacological dose on GBM cell and normal cell. The difference in H2O2 metabolism and iron metabolism is the signature of ascorbate selectivity toward cancer cells. Oxidation of ascorbate in the extracellular space produces H2O2 that enters the cell. In normal cells, ascorbate enters using SVCT2 and exhibits a high ability to metabolize H2O2, therefore iron metabolism is well maintained resulting in low cellular levels of labile iron (Fe2+). In GBM cells, dehydroascorbate enters using GLUT1; however, SVCT2 functionality is changed resulting in a change in the amount of ascorbate within cancer cells (dotted line) which hampers H2O2 metabolism. Subsequently, there is a build-up of H2O2 and disturbance in iron metabolism to enhance the levels of labile iron (Fe2+) within cancer cells. The intercellular conversion of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate aids in this process. The enhanced accumulation of cellular Fe2+ triggers free radical production, as well as decreased redox equivalent resulting in making GBM cells susceptible to vitamin C.

Resveratrol exhibits both chemopreventive (via antiproliferative, anti-metastatic, anti-invasive, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic effects) and chemotherapeutic effects (via apoptotic induction) by regulating several signaling events.

  "figure_6": "Metabolic reprogramming in brain cancer cell as compared with the normal cell. Brain tumor cell depends on glycolysis for glucose oxidation instead of oxidative phosphorylation and uses more glutamine. Cancer cells predominantly convert glucose into lactate even in the abundance of oxygen; this is referred to as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. The lactate aids in acidifying the tumor microenvironment and endorses invasion. Glioma cells also utilize glutamine as a substrate to enter the TCA involving IDH. Mutation of the IDH gene potentiates the formation of oncogenic 2-HG from α-KG. The metabolic reprogramming is executed by activation suppression of several transcription factors.
