Fluorescein-PLGA was observable under both white and blue light through cleared sclera.",
  "figure_3": "MI3 method does not disrupt retinal structure of implant-injected mouse eyes\n(A) Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) shows that there is no significant difference in retinal structures between the control eye and implant-injected eye at 6 weeks post injection (n = 6 for each group). Infrared scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO; yellow box) and OCT (right panel) images of an implant-injected eye are shown. Green lines on infrared SLO image indicate the regions where OCT images were taken.\n(B) Representative images of pupil-optic nerve section (n = 4 for each group). No significant difference was observed between control and implant-injected eyes. Compared with control eyes (left), no significant difference was observed in implant-injected eyes (right).\n(C) Representative images of retina section. Retinas were detached from eye and sectioned for imaging. Histologic analysis of retina sections shows no significant difference between control and implant-injected eye, and it confirms that there are no signs of inflammation or cell death (n = 6 for each group).",
  "figure_4": "MI3 method does not disrupt retinal function of implant-injected mouse eyes, and the implant sustainedly releases drug in vivo\n(A) Electroretinography comparison of the scotopic 1.0 global ERG and photopic 3.0 (flash strength in cd.s.m−2) in implant-injected eyes and no-injection control eyes (n = 6 for each group). No significant difference was observed between control and test groups.\n(B) Left panel: live image of albino-mouse eye injected with the 2-mm Cy5.5-PLGA implant taken right after the surgery. Cylinder-shaped dark blue object (Cy5.5-PLGA) can be clearly observed through mouse lens. Middle panel: near-infrared (NIR) image of enucleated eyes with Cy5.5-PLGA implant, free Cy5.5 solution, and no injection control. Strong NIR fluorescence signal was detected in implant-injected eye, whereas other eyes did not show any NIR signals. This suggests that model drug was washed out from eye within 3 days, whereas the implant prolonged drug retention time in mouse vitreous. Right panel: the amount of remaining Cy5.5 in eyes at 3 days post injection was quantified (minimum n = 4 for each group; data displayed as mean ± SEM). Implant-injected eyes had significant amounts of drug left compared to free-Cy5.5-injected or control groups (∗∗∗∗: p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between free-Cy5.5-injected and control groups."
