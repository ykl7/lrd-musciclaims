No significant difference was observed between control and test groups.\n(B) Left panel: live image of albino-mouse eye injected with the 2-mm Cy5.5-PLGA implant taken right after the surgery. Cylinder-shaped dark blue object (Cy5.5-PLGA) can be clearly observed through mouse lens. Middle panel: near-infrared (NIR) image of enucleated eyes with Cy5.5-PLGA implant, free Cy5.5 solution, and no injection control. Strong NIR fluorescence signal was detected in implant-injected eye, whereas other eyes did not show any NIR signals. This suggests that model drug was washed out from eye within 3 days, whereas the implant prolonged drug retention time in mouse vitreous. Right panel: the amount of remaining Cy5.5 in eyes at 3 days post injection was quantified (minimum n = 4 for each group; data displayed as mean ± SEM). Implant-injected eyes had significant amounts of drug left compared to free-Cy5.5-injected or control groups (∗∗∗∗: p < 0.0001).
