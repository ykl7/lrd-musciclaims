  "figure_1": "Brain metastatic (BrM) cell lines have been established from human or mice parental cells (derived from primary tumors, pleural fluids or lymph node metastasis). Depending on the model, some cell lines were labelled with fluorescent (i.e. GFP) and/or bioluminescent (Luc) reporters and they underwent subsequent in vivo selection, for 0–5 rounds. Alternatively, spontaneous metastasis obtained from patients or mice (i.e. derived from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) or orthotopic injections) could be a direct source of BrM cell lines, without the need of performing in vivo selection. The BrMPanel has 60 cell lines from breast cancer (38 cell lines, 63.3%), lung cancer (8 cell lines, 13.3%) and melanoma (14 cell lines, 23.3%) of human (h), mouse (m), or rat (r) origins. Molecular drivers and cancer subtypes are represented for each cancer type: Breast cancer: 16 entries of HER2+, 42.1%; 19 entries of triple-negative breast cancer patients (TNBC), 50.0%; 3 entries of other, 7.9%; Lung cancer: KRAS mutant and p53 null (1 out of 8 cell lines of 12.5%) or EGFR alterations (3 out of 8 cell lines, 37.5%); Melanoma: 8 BRAF mutant cell lines (57.1%) and 3 Ret alterations (21.4%). Analysis of the molecular profiles correspond to the parental cell lines."
