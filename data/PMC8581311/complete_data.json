      "caption": "Mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. (A) Mechanisms of tamoxifen (TAM) resistance may involve the loss of oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha expression, which can be achieved by methylation of CpG islands or histone deacetylase activity in the ESR1 promoter. Tamoxifen‐resistant growth is also stimulated by the upregulation of growth factor signalling pathways (HER2, IGF‐IR and FGFR) and subsequent activation of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade or phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K) pathway. Finally, tamoxifen has even been shown to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells when bound to certain coactivators, such as AIB1, and this is especially true in HER2‐expressing cells. (B) The mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance share similarities with tamoxifen resistance, especially in terms of growth factor pathway upregulation. The enhanced activity of growth factors such as MAPK can result in oestrogen‐independent phosphorylation and activation of ERα. In addition to growth factor signalling, interferon response genes and anti‐apoptotic proteins have also been shown to have increased expression in AI‐resistant cells.

      "caption": "Pathway circuitry dictates therapeutic response. (A) For tumours with defined genetic lesions, the ability to overcome a given targeted therapeutic lies in whether or not they need to acquire a secondary genetic mutation to overcome the effect of the drug on critical downstream biochemical effectors that are required for continued tumour cell growth, or whether they can simply upregulate existing alternative routes that lead to effectors already expressed in those cells. So, the drug places selection pressure to ramp up existing bypass routes. If there are no such routes to the critical downstream effectors, a specific mutation to upregulate those alternative routes or bypass the drug are required. In this example, a critical target for tumour cell growth and survival is the activation of eIF4E and HIF. Tumours with initiating mutations in RTKs, Ras or Raf have multiple routes to signal to eIF4E and HIF, so blocking mTOR with rapamycin does not inhibit these tumours. (B) In contrast, tumours with initiating lesions in PI(3)K or more direct regulators of mTOR (such as LKB1 and TSC) do not have alternative routes to activate eIF4E and HIF. Hence these tumours show greater response to rapamycin. (C) Similarly, the expression and use of specific adaptor proteins that enhance certain arms of pathway signalling will dictate the therapeutic response. In the example shown, human lung tumours expressing epidermal‐growth‐factor receptor (EGFR) are targeted with anti‐EGFR drugs such as Iressa or Tarceva. In tumours expressing the ERBB3 heterodimerization partner, EGFR efficiently enhances PI(3)K activation through a number of PI(3)K‐binding sites in ERBB3. (D) In tumours that lack ERBB3, PI(3)K is still activated by a number of other routes, including adaptors such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Reprinted from [86]. Copyright© 2006, Nature",

JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylates PAK1 on Y153, 201, and 285, enhancing PAK1 kinase and scaffolding activities. PRL treatment also leads to FAK auto‐phosphorylation at Y397. Activated PAK1 phosphorylates MEK1 at S298, resulting in increased MEK1/ERK binding and enhanced ERK activity. Active ERK phosphorylates FAK at S910, leading to dephosphorylation of FAK at Y397 by the tyrosine phosphatase PTP‐PEST as shown by Zheng et al. (2009).
