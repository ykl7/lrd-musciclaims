  "figure_1": "The microbiome in the intestinal lumen can impact the brain through metabolites as well as immune cell regulation by induction, training, maturation, or suppression followed by cytokine production. Red arrows in the right panel highlight tumor-promoting pathways, while green arrows indicate tumor-inhibitory pathways.",
