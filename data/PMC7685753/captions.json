  "figure_1": "(A) Timeline of diagnoses and histologic characteristics of GCT and blood cancers from all 15 patients. Each patient is shown in a row on the x axis and timeline of diagnosis is shown on the y axis. AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; HLH, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome. (B) Kaplan-Meier curve of the patients from A. Survival is shown as time from diagnosis of GCT. Median survival is 6.3 months (95% CI 4.6–25.2 months). (C) Shown are the most prevalent genetic alterations in patients with mediastinal GCTs and no secondary malignancy diagnosis (left; n = 51), mediastinal GCT with hematologic malignancy (middle; n = 11; composite for GCT and hematologic malignancy samples shown), or de novo AML (n = 200, from the AML TCGA; ref. 13). (D) DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) in the same cohorts of patients from C (genomic gains and losses are red and blue, respectively). GCT and hematologic malignancy samples displayed separately for CNAs (GCT = 8, HM = 9 patients [11 samples]).",
  "figure_2": "Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 5 patients, 3 shown here and 2 shown in Figures 3 and 4. (A) Shown are the somatic mutations (known oncogenic and variants of undetermined significance [VUS]) and their fraction of tumor cells mutated (cancer cell fraction [CCF]), the (B) allelic DNA copy number, and (C) inferred evolutionary relationships of a GCT and associated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a 24-year-old male with both diagnoses. An ancestral clone with shared isochromosome 12p and a KRAS G12S mutation (among other shared mutations) was detected followed by independent acquisition of numerous distinct mutations. (D–F) Similar CCF (D), allele copy number (E), and evolutionary relationships (F) in a 28-year-old with shared GCT and AML. In this case, both tumors derived from a TP53 R248L–mutant ancestral precursor that underwent copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH). (G–J) In another patient, a KRAS G12D–mutant precursor gave rise to GCT and MDS, each of which later independently acquired TP53 hotspot mutations with CNLOH. (I) Aligned TP53 reads over the regions of mutations, highlighting mutual exclusivity of each mutation across the GCT and MDS samples. AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.",
  "figure_3": "(A) Cancer cell fraction (CCF) of mutations, (B) allele copy number (middle), (C) evolutionary relationship, and (D) histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin stain) of a 19-year-old patient successively diagnosed with a GCT, histiocytic sarcoma, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Scale bars: 200 μm (black) and 1 μm (white). The timeline of acquisition of each diagnosis is shown at the top of A. In this case, TP53 Q144Rfs*26 mutation undergoing copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity defined the ancestral precursor with a PIK3CD mutation that gave rise to all 4 malignancies. This was followed by divergent evolution of 1 intermediate precursor that gave rise to the GCT and AML and another that resulted in development of the histiocytic sarcoma and CMML. MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; CNLOH, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity.",
  "figure_4": "(A) Clinical course of a 25-year-old patient with metastatic primary mediastinal nonseminomatous GCT who was treated with multiple salvage chemotherapy regiments (VIP: etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin; TICE: paclitaxel, ifosfamide, followed by high-dose carboplatin plus etoposide) as well as autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). This was followed by development of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 1 year after GCT diagnosis, treated by allogeneic SCT. A histiocytic sarcoma was then found 1 year after allogeneic SCT based on a PET/CT scan. (B) Histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin stain) of the yolk sac and teratoma component of the GCT as well as MDS and histiocytic sarcoma. Scale bars: 200 μm (black) and 1 μm (white). (C) Somatic mutations in TP53, BCOR, and NRAS illustrate the clonal relationships of the GCT, MDS, and histiocytic sarcoma versus the auto-SCT product. (D) The cancer cell fraction (CCF) of both shared and distinct somatic mutations in the GCT and MDS. (E) Copy number analysis of the GCT and MDS. (F) Evolutionary relationship of the GCT, MDS, and histiocytic sarcoma. (G) Aligned TP53 reads over the regions of mutations, highlighting mutual exclusivity of each mutation across the GCT and MDS samples compared with the histiocytic sarcoma sample. CNLOH, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity; VAF, variant allele frequency; VUS, variants of undetermined significance."
