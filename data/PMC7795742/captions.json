  "figure_2": "From authors Rey-Barroso et al. [43], multispectral (MS) imaging devices (a) General view of the previously developed handheld visible to the near-infrared (VIS-NIR) MS device. (b) General view of the handheld extended near-infrared (exNIR) MS device. (c) Clinical measurement and metallic ring, which is glued to the patient’s skin for the tip of both systems to place them in the same position and parallel to the skin, without making any contact. (d) MS images of a melanoma (top) and a nevi (bottom). The structure of the melanoma is still visible at the longest wavelengths.",
  "figure_3": "From Rey-Barroso et al. [65], (a) 3D fringe projector. The fringe images are reconstructed and unwrapped to obtain 3D images with superimposed color texture. A pigmented lesion and its heights maps are shown below. (b) Three-dimensional (3D) topographical images of a melanoma (top) and a nevi (bottom). The melanoma seems to have a rougher profile.",
  "figure_4": "Schematic representation of an SS-OCT imaging system. u is the reference signal and A is the interference signal that produces the image of the different layers of the skin.",
  "figure_5": "Confocal Laser Feedback Tomography as proposed by Mowla et al. [90]. The green dashed lines represent the out-of-focus reflections that are eliminated by the aperture of the 850 nm VCSEL acting as source/detector. The injection current was modulated to generate the interferometric fringes from the three-layer KC-Tissue phantom.",
  "figure_6": "(a) Diagram of the interaction of a focused laser beam on particles that flow at different velocities within a capillary. (b) Confocal SMI-based Doppler flowmeter (SMDF) developed by Yáñez et. al. [91], which allows reconstructing the flow profile of liquids flowing in capillaries. This prototype is projected as a useful tool in the diagnosis of sprouting angiogenesis.",
  "figure_7": "Stokes and Mueller matrix imaging (MMI) setup. The Stokes imaging setup included the sample and the polarization state analyzer (PSA). The PSA is a quarter wave plate (QWP) followed by a polarizer (P) and the optical relays (f2) to focus the light onto the sensor. The MMI setup consists in the previous setup with a polarization state generator (PSG). The PSG comprises a light source, a polarizer (P), and a QWP. The optical set (f1) focuses the input light on the sample.",
