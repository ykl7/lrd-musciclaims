Circulating blood markers such as CTCs and ctDNA are gaining prominence in cancer diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and development of personalized medicine. However, to bring these liquid biopsy markers into clinical practice, strategies for integrative analyses of these bio-analytes along with existing diagnostic tools need to be developed.
