Amino acid numbers are given according to the beginning and end of each functional domain. FERM, four-point-one ezrin, radixin, moesin domain; SH2, Src homology domain 2.",
  "figure_2": "Three- or 4-generation pedigrees collected for family 1 and family 2. The first illustrates the segregation of p.R564Q with ET and CLL in family 1. The proband in family 2 was identified to have the p.R564L variant. Her son is reported to have thrombocytosis (∼500 × 103/μL) but has not had genetic testing. +, positive for JAK2 variant; –, negative for JAK2 variant; dx, diagnosed.",
  "figure_4": "Structural impact of the p.R564L mutation on JAK2 protein.JAK2 p.R564I leads to disruption of local structure. (A) Ribbon diagram of full-length JAK2 (amino acids, 1-1132; UniProt ID O60674) modeled using AlphaFold,27,28 followed by loop refinement using Modeller.29,30 Coloring corresponds with the regional pLDDT score as shown in the key. (B) The amino acids within 5 Å of arginine 564 are highlighted and shown with ball and stick models. Hydrogen-bond and van der Waals interactions are depicted as dashed lines. The p.R564L mutation is expected to disrupt key interactions with nearby residues including His538, E566, Y613, T576, and His574, altering the local structural integrity.",
