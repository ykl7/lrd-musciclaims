      "caption": "The functions and functional mechanism of circRNAs in breast cancer. (A) CircRNAs manifest multiple functions by altering metabolism, immune regulation, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and thus involve in breast carcinogenesis, progression and drug resistance of breast cancer. Moreover, their potential as biomarkers has been recently highlighted. (B) The functional mechanism of circRNAs. (a) Acting as miRNA sponge, circRNAs are rich in numerous miRNA binding sites and can competitively bind to miRNAs. (b) By binding to proteins, circRNAs affect the functions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and the interactions among RBPs. (c) CircRNAs can upregulate the transcription through interacting with the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) complex. (d) CircRNAs can be translated into proteins. The figure is drawn by Figdraw.",
