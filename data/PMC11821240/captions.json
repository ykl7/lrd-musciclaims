  "figure_1": "Pathway of Vitamin D3 synthesis and metabolism in the skin, liver, and kidneys along with non-canonical pathways of vitamin D3, lumisterol3, and tachysterol3 activation. Exposure to solar ultraviolet B radiation (UVB; 290–315 nm) initiates the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in the skin to previtamin D3, which is then converted to vitamin D3 in a heat-dependent process. Excessive solar UVB exposure can degrade both previtamin D3 and vitamin D3 into inactive photoproducts. Vitamin D3, lumisterol3 (L3), tachysterol3 (T3), and 7-DHC act as substrates for the enzyme CYP11A1, which, either independently or in cooperation with other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, produces the corresponding hydroxylated derivatives. In the case of L3 and 7-DHC, CYP11A1 can cleave the side chain to produce 7-dehydropregnenolone (7-DHP) or pregnalumisterol (pL), which are further metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes (ES). In the skin, UVB radiation acting on 5,7-dienes leads to the production of D3, L3, and T3 derivatives with a full-length side chain, as well as pregnacalciferol (pD), pL and pregnatachysterol (pT) derivatives with a shortened side chain. Vitamin D3 is then transported into the bloodstream, where it binds to the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), which facilitates its delivery to the liver. In the liver, vitamin D3 is hydroxylated by either CYP2R1 or CYP27A1 to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], an inactive precursor. This form must undergo further hydroxylation in the kidneys by CYP27B1 to produce the biologically active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. The active metabolite regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis by enhancing intestinal absorption. In osteoblasts, 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to its receptor, promoting the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). RANKL then binds to its receptor, RANK, on preosteoclasts, triggering their differentiation into mature osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts remove calcium and phosphorus from the bone, helping maintain blood concentrations of calcium (Ca2+) and phosphorus in the blood, which are critical not only for skeletal mineralization but also for most metabolic functions. Adequate Ca2+ and phosphorus (HPO42−) levels promote the mineralization of the skeleton.

  "figure_2": "Multifaceted role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in mitigating oxidative stress, UVB-induced DNA damage, and apoptosis in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes not only produce vitamin D3 in response to ultraviolet B (UVB; 290–315 nm) radiation but also possess the enzymatic machinery to convert it into its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Solar UVB radiation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within epidermal kerotinocytes, reulting in oxidative stress and DNA damage, including bulky adducts and intrastrand crosslinks such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PP). ROS activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 pathways, which amplify the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In mitochondria, UVB-induced oxidative stress disrupts the balance between pro-apoptotic (BAX) and anti-apoptotic (BCL2) proteins, facilitating the release of cytochrome c (Cyto C). This triggers apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis via caspase-9 and caspase-3. Metallothionein (MT), a ROS-scavenging protein, is upregulated as a defense mechanism to mitigate oxidative damage. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, enhances MT expression through its interaction with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). This complex modulates transcription by binding to vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in target genes. 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a protective role by reducing oxidative stress, limiting inflammatory responses, and sustaining MT function. 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduces the formation of CPDs and 6-4PP in keratinocytes following UVB exposure. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes apoptosis in damaged cells, thereby preventing their transformation into malignant tumors. Green arrow represents the influence of 1,25(OH)2D3 on DNA damage, ROS and apoptosis. The up arrows (↑) and down arrows (↓) represent increases and decreases various biologic functions.

  "figure_3": "Interplay between UVB-induced vitamin D3 synthesis, keratinocyte signaling, and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. Solar ultraviolet B (UVB, 290–315 nm) radiation penetrates the epidermis, initiating vitamin D3 synthesis, DNA damage, and inflammation within the skin. Epidermal keratinocytes possess the enzymatic machinery to convert vitamin D3 into its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). In the nucleus, 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This complex modulates gene transcription by binding to vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in target genes. 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating the activity of various immune cells that express the VDR. It suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine release, contributing to immune regulation and tumor suppression. In keratinocytes, 1,25(OH)2D3 influences the production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as well as chemokines like chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1(CXCL1), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20). Notably, it decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL20) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, enhancing skin immune homeostasis. Dendritic cells (DCs), including Langerhans cells (LCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), are key antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin. 1,25(OH)2D3 reduces the expression of activation markers such as CD14, CD40, CD80, and CD86 in DCs, promoting a tolerogenic state that mitigates excessive immune activation and autoimmunity. In pDCs, 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances the production of interferon alpha (IFN-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), crucial for anti-viral immunity. 1,25(OH)2D3 also balances the activities of T helper 1 cells (Th1) and T helper 2 cells (Th2) cells. Th1 cells produce interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and TNF, driving pro-inflammatory responses against intracellular pathogens. In contrast, Th2 cells secrete interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-6, and IL-10, which support anti-inflammatory and allergic responses. By modulating Th1/Th2 balance, 1,25(OH)2D3 prevents chronic inflammation and immune suppression, maintaining immune equilibrium. Vitamin D suppresses T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation, reducing IL-17 production (a pro-inflammatory cytokine), and promotes Treg activity. Tregs secrete IL-10, fostering immune tolerance and reducing inflammation. This shift from Th17 to Treg dominance supports immune regulation. In macrophages, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces M2 polarization, increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, which facilitate tissue repair and wound healing. Additionally, it stimulates the production of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), including cathelicidin and β-defensin, by macrophages, bolstering the skin’s defense against infections. M2 macrophages also contribute to collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix formation, essential for tissue regeneration. The up arrows (↑) and down arrows (↓) represent increases and decreases in production and release of cytokines and other biologic agents by various cells associated with the skin in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 respectively.
