  "figure_7": "The involvement of Akt and KRas pathways in brain cancer. Akt and KRas pathways are majorly involved in progression of cancer. These two pathways are influenced by PKCε, TPD52, miR-124 and KLF14, in addition to several other downstream effectors. The deregulated expression of TPD52, KLF14 and miR-124 and PKCε contribute to the over-expression of these two oncogenic pathways which in turn promotes cell survival and proliferation.",
  "figure_8": "Sequence alignment of Kruppel like factors depicting conserved domains obtained from Clustal Omega. Certain sequence alignments have been deleted for formatting, Zinc figure domain 1(labeled as green), zinc figure domain 2 (labeled as purple) and zinc figure domain 3 (labeled as blue) have been highlighted.",
  "figure_9": "Phylogenetic analysis of KLF family. The evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA method. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 7.54632578 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. This analysis involved 15 amino acid sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There was a total of 602 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X42.",
  "figure_10": "Tertiary structure prediction of KLF14 through homology modelling. (A) 3D structure of KLF14—Alpha helices, beta sheets, coils and three zinc ions are shown. (B) Ramachandran plot examining the quality of the model. The majority of the amino acids are traced out in the favoured region exhibiting that the model is of good stereochemical quality. (C) Superimposed structure of KLF14 (green) and KLF4 as template (red). KLF14 shows matching with alpha helices of template protein chain and a Q-Score of 0.976.",
  "figure_11": "KLF14’s domains and cellular localization. (A) Primary structure of KLF14 showing the uniqueness of protein. Three zinc finger domains at C terminus and Sin3A binding domain at N terminus. (B) Localization of KLF14. DeepLOc 1.032 shows strong evidence of the presence of KLF14 inside nucleus."
