These two pathways are influenced by PKCε, TPD52, miR-124 and KLF14, in addition to several other downstream effectors. The deregulated expression of TPD52, KLF14 and miR-124 and PKCε contribute to the over-expression of these two oncogenic pathways which in turn promotes cell survival and proliferation.",
