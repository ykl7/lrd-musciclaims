  "figure_1": "(A) At a low frequency, notum(RNAi) homeostasis animals form an additional set of ectopic eyes (8/111) animals at 70d RNAi to generate 6-eyed animals. (B) Alternatively, 6-eyed animals can be produced at higher frequency by decapitating 4-eyed notum(RNAi) animals generated by homeostatic inhibition. (C) Experiments to test regenerative ability of the three sets of eyes from 6-eyed notum(RNAi) animals. Only the anterior-most set of eyes can regenerate (top panels vs. middle panels). Removal of a set of three eyes from the same side of these worms results in regeneration only of the anterior-most set of eyes.",
  "figure_2": "Control RNAi and 4-eyed notum(RNAi) animals were prepared by homeostatic inhibition for 40 days, resected to remove either normal, anterior or posterior eyes as shown, then fixed at 0 hr or 6 hr and stained for expression of jun-1, fos-1, and gpc-1. Injury-induced gene expression was similar between control and notum(RNAi) animals and between removal of either anterior or posterior eyes.",
  "figure_3": "(A) WISH to detect expression of sFRP-1 and ndl-3 in control and notum(RNAi) regenerating head fragments, marking regenerative eyes (green arrows) and non-regenerative eyes (blue arrows). Posterior eyes in notum(RNAi) animals were located more distantly from the sFRP-1 domain (3/3 animals) and within the ndl-3 expression domain (6/6 animals), whereas eyes from control animals were located outside of the ndl-3 domain (5/5 animals). (B) Measurement of control and notum(RNAi) eyes with respect to the body from fixed stained animals prepared as in (A). In notum(RNAi) animals, the supernumerary eyes are positioned more anterior and the pre-existing eyes are positioned more posterior than eyes from control animals. (C–D) Testing the position of eyes with respect to the brain. (C) Animals were prepared as in (A) and stained with a cintillo riboprobe labeling chemosensory neurons within a lateral territory of the head. The notum(RNAi) posterior eyes are located too far posterior with respect to the cintillo cell domain. (D) Measurement of the location of regenerative and non-regenerative eyes with respect to the brain, as visualized by FISH to detect tyrosinase and Hoechst staining that outlines the planarian cephalic ganglia. Right, quantifications of relative eye:brain position as determined by normalizing to the length of the brain as indicated with respect to the brain’s axis. Non-regenerative eyes from notum(RNAi) animals (blue) have a more posterior location than eyes from control animals (red) or regenerative eyes from notum(RNAi) animals (green). ***, p-value<0.001 by 2-tailed t-test. n.s., p>0.05 by 2-tailed t-test.",
  "figure_4": "Top, images of animals stained for ovo expression by FISH fixed 4 days after eye removal from control and notum(RNAi) animals as shown in cartoons. The anterior half of each animal was imaged and ovo+ cells manually scored from maximum projection images, scoring eye progenitors as ovo+ cells not residing within the mature eyes. Bottom left, quantification of overall numbers of ovo+ cells animals after each treatment. notum RNAi and either anterior or posterior eye removal did not substantially later numbers of ovo+ cells (p>0.05, 2-tailed t-tests). Bottom right, quantification of ovo+ cells based on localization on the uninjured (left) or injured (right) side of each animal. There was not a difference in number of ovo+ cells between uninjured and injured sides across all treatments (2-tailed paired t-tests).",
  "figure_5": "Animals were fed ndk dsRNA 6 times over 2 weeks then decapitated and regenerating head fragments scored 21 days later for ectopic eyes (15/31 animals). Animals displaying this phenotype were selected for eye resection to remove either an original anterior eye or a supernumerary posterior eye. Removal of the anterior eye resulted in regeneration (5/5 animals), while regeneration was not observed after removal of posterior eyes (7/7) as scored 14 and 21 days later.",
  "figure_6": "WISH to detect expression of five different positional control genes in a timeseries during the regeneration of head fragments (zic-1, wnt2-1, ndl-2, ndl-3 and wntP-2). At d4 of regeneration, positional control gene expression domains have altered but not yet acquired their final distributions. For example, zic-1 expression appears overly reduced compared to 12 days of regeneration, and wnt2-1, ndl-2, and ndl-3 expression occupies too much of the axis, and the wntP-2 expression axis has not yet resolved. These observations suggest that early in regeneration, positional control genes are mispositioned with respect to pre-existing tissues. All images representative of at least n = 4 animals per timepoint and condition. Bars, 300 microns.",
  "figure_7": "(A) Model showing shifts to the anteroposterior target site of eye regeneration (yellow box) in animals undergoing notum RNAi or wnt11-6 and fzd5/8-4 RNAi. Eye progenitors (purple dots) are present in a broader anterior domain and can renew pre-existing eyes left behind by the pattern alteration. (B) Shifts to the location of eye regeneration during the remodeling of head fragments (top series). Eye removal during this process results in eye regeneration at the target location for proportion re-establishment (bottom series)."
