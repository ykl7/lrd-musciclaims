  "figure_1": "a Study subject with abnormal OCT imaging and microperimetry plot in fellow eye. (a, b) Optic disc scanning laser ophthalmoscopic images demonstrate an inferior notch in the right optic disc with focal ischaemic glaucoma and a healthy appearing optic disc on the left. (c, d) OCT of peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer demonstrating thinning of the right infero-temporal and left supero-temporal RNFL. (e, f) Standard automated perimetry (24-2, SITA standard) pattern standard deviation plots of right and left eyes demonstrating a split-fixation visual field defect in the right eye (supero-nasal). The left PSD plot shows non-specific visual field changes in the infero-nasal quadrant. (g, h) Microperimetry plots demonstrate reduced retinal sensitivity in the infero-temporal macula close to fixation in the right eye and reduced retinal sensitivity in the inner supero-temporal ring of the left eye. b Study subject with abnormal OCT imaging and microperimetry in the fellow eye. (a, b) Optic disc SLO images demonstrate a left inferior notch with peripapillary atrophy. The right optic disc demonstrates peripapillary atrophy with mild tilting of the optic disc but no clear notch. (c, d) OCT scan of peripapillary RNFL demonstrating thinning of the right supero-nasal RNFL and left supero-temoral and infero-temporal RNFL. (e, f) Standard automated perimetry pattern standard deviation plots demonstrate a superior visual field defect in the left eye, splitting fixation. The right eye demonstrates non-specific changes with normal glaucoma hemifield test. (g, h) Microperimetry plots demonstrate reduced retinal sensitivity in the infero-temporal macula close to fixation in the left eye. The right eye demonstrates reduced retinal sensitivity in the superior macula when compared to the inferior macula. c A study subject with normal OCT imaging and abnormal microperimetry in fellow eye. (a, b) SLO images demonstrate a right inferior notch and healthy appearing left optic disc. (c, d) OCT demonstrates thinning of the right infero-temporal RNFL, the left RNFL is normal. (e, f) HVF PSD plots demonstrate a scotoma superiorly in the right eye close to fixation, most prominent in the supero-nasal sector. The left visual field is full. (g, h) Microperimetry plots demonstrate a reduction in retinal sensitivity in the right inferior macula. The left microperimetry plot demonstrates reduced retinal sensitivity in the superior macula within the inner ring (with abnormal global index reported by the MAIA software)",
  "figure_2": "a Comparison of average microperimetry thresholds in focal ischaemic glaucoma eyes (1) and fellow study eyes (2). A clear reduction in threshold sensitivity in the eyes with focal ischemic glaucoma is demonstrated (p < 0.0001) (dB decibels). b Microperimetry thresholds (average) in the fellow eyes when compared between OCT classifications. (1) Patients with fellow eye classed as RED (significant thinning) on OCT global index of RNFL thickness when compared to age-matched controls. (2) Patients with fellow eye classed as GREEN (no thinning) on OCT global index of RNFL thickness. This demonstrates no difference between the two groups: microperimetry does not detect differences between patients with structurally normal and structurally abnormal peripapillary RNFL thickness on OCT imaging. dB decibels",
  "figure_3": "Summation of retinal sensitivity as determined by microperimetry in a eyes with focal ischaemic glaucoma and b fellow eyes. The plots represent retinal sensitivity rather than visual field abnormalities. The inferior retina appears to have reduced sensitivity in the eyes with glaucoma. The fellow eyes have reduced retinal sensitivity in the centre of the fovea and inferiorly close to fixation. The difference in retinal sensitivity between superior and inferior retina increases with eccentricity, such that the outer ring is most abnormal in comparison to the inner and middle rings (as demonstrated in Supplementary Figure 2)"
