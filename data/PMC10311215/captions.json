  "figure_1": "Photograph of the left eye of case 1 (congenital cataract) showing both up and down drift with scores for various eye positions. Eye seen in up-drifted position (+4) before the start of surgery (MAC = 1), following which sevoflurane concentration was increased and eye slowly drifted down (+4 to +1) (A–D), became centralized momentarily (E) but overshot or drifted in downgaze (F–I), and eye assumed an eccentric position in downgaze (−1 to −4) at MAC = 1.8. MAC, minimum alveolar concentration.",
  "figure_2": "ROC curve of MAC for DEEM/EDP in (A) ≤ 2 years and (B) > 2 years: The cut off value of MAC for EDEM/ EDEP from ROC curve came out to be 1.65 in ≤ 2 years (71.7% sensitivity and 95% specificity) and 1.75 in >2 years (78.9%sensitivity and 92.9 % specificity). ROC, receiver operating characteristics; EDEM/EDEP-eccentric downward eye movement/eccentric downward eye-positioning; MAC-minimal alveolar concentration.",
  "figure_3": "Photograph of eyes of patients who showed downdrift alone without updrift. (A, B) Both eyes of case 2 (before botulinum injection) showed (A) symmetric down-positioning of eyes before the start of surgery (MAC 1.4) when eyes were cleaned, draped, and opened following which (B) sevoflurane concentration was decreased and eyes returned to the central position (MAC = 1.2) within a minute of decreasing sevoflurane concentration. It should be noted that recorded values of MAC at the time of intubation were 1.7 and MAC was stabilized to 1.4 within a few minutes of decreasing sevoflurane concentration after intubation when eyes were opened to see their position at the time of cleaning and draping. (C, D) The right eye of patient 2 (before second botulinum injection) at 14 months of age in the central position (MAC = 1) at the time of the start of surgery (C) but as anesthesia was deepened (to improve oxygen saturation as patient was not able to maintain spontaneous breathing), eye turned in and down (D) after temporary release of muscle traction during surgery following passage of traction suture, conjunctival incision, and hooking of muscle. (at MAC = 1.4) (E, F) Photographs of eccentric eye positioning in downgaze with slight adduction (toward the nose) in left eye before start of surgery in case 3 (infantile esotropia) (MAC = 1.6) (E) and after eye achieved centralized position when the depth of anesthesia was decreased (MAC 1.3). MAC, minimum alveolar concentration.",
  "figure_4": "Pre-operative photograph of both eyes showing asymmetric down-positioning of eyes in case 4 (infantile esotropia) (A) Right eye more down-positioned than left eye at MAC = 2. (B) Pre-operative clinical profile of same patient showing esotropia with left eye Dissociated vertical deviation. MAC, minimum alveolar concentration."
