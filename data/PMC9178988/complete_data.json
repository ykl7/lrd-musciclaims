      "caption": "Diagram of neural versus cancer stem cell differentiation. The model is a simplified version of the differentiation between neural stem cells (yellow) and brain tumor stem cells (purple) in the formation of brain tumors. Neural stem cells and brain tumor stem cells share similar characteristics such as self-renewal and differentiation. Neural stem cells differentiate into unrestricted progenitor cells which give rise to either glial progenitors or neural progenitors. The glial precursors differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes while the neural precursor will form the neuron. Similarly, brain tumor stem cells have the ability to generate a wide range of differentiated progeny. Brain tumor stem cells can develop from mutations accumulated in neural stem cells and in both their restricted and unrestricted progeny that have the ability to self-renew.",
