  "figure_1": "Preoperative images before Kpro surgery in dry eye disease. (a) Post–toxic epidermal necrolysis, corneal neovascularization with total leukomatous corneal scar is found in eye. A Boston type II Kpro was performed in this eye; the postoperative image is shown in Fig. 3b. (b) Post–acid injury, an eye showing superior symblepharon with total leukomatous corneal scar with dermalization of the corneal surface. A tibial Kpro was performed in this eye; the postoperative image is shown in Fig. 3c. (c) Post-Stevens–Johnson syndrome sequelae. Superior symblepharon with dermalization of the entire ocular surface with underlying total leukomatous corneal scar and severe dry eye disease; an LVP Kpro was performed in this eye. Kpro = keratoprosthesis",

(b) Complete ankyloblepharon with dermalization of the ocular surface 2 years after TEN. (c) The postoperative image of the same eye, 3months after the ocular surface mucous membrane grafting was performed. (d) Six months after Lux keratoprosthesis. TEN = toxic epidermal necrolysis",
  "figure_3": "Different types of keratoprosthesis in dry eye disease secondary to chronic cicatrizing conjunctivitis. (a) Left eye of a patient 5 years after MOOKP was performed for ocular sequelae secondary to SJS. (b) Left eye of a patient 14 years after Boston type II keratoprosthesis was performed for SJS sequelae. (c) Right eye of a patient 5 years after tibial keratoprosthesis was performed for ocular chemical burn secondary to acid injury. (d) Right eye of a patient 4.5 years after LVP keratoprosthesis was performed for SJS sequelae. (e) Right eye of a patient 3 months after Lux keratoprosthesis was performed for SJS sequelae. MOOKP = modified osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis, SJS = Stevens–Johnson syndrome"
