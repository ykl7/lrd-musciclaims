  "figure_1": "Experimental models of brain cancer induce sustained thymic involution. (A) Experimental design is shown. Mice are implanted with 60 000 luciferase-bearing GL261 cells or 10 000 B16-F1 melanoma cells in the frontal lobe of the brain 3-mm deep. Gross analysis of thymi taken from a GL261 tumour- bearing mouse compared to a tumour-negative mouse. Thymi were analysed at the time glioma-bearing mice become moribund. (B) Survival of GL261 tumour-bearing mice is shown. Tumour take is 70–90% rendering the remaining 10–30% tumour-negative. Survival plot only shows tumour-bearing mice. (C) Thymic weight (D) and cellularity is compared between GL261 tumour-bearing and tumour-negative mice at the time glioma-bearing mice become moribund. Tumour-negative and tumour-bearing mice are age-matched. Similarly (E and F) GL261- bearing mice have significantly smaller thymi as measured by thymic weight and cellularity compared to naïve unmanipulated mice. (G) Subcutaneous implantation of GL261-Luc cells did not result in thymic involution. (H) Thymic cellularity was inversely correlated with tumour burden in GL261-Luc tumour-bearing mice. Mice were binned based on bioluminescence imaging at the time of euthanasia and thymic cellularity was plotted against tumour burden (as measured by bioluminescence intensity). Bioluminescence intensity (photon/s) was calculated by placing a circular region of interest over the head. Mice with bioluminescence intensities above 105 (photon/s) were considered to be tumour-bearing whereas those below 105 (photon/s) were considered to be tumour-negative. (I) Thymic weight and (J) cellularity are compared between PBS-injected and B16-F1 melanoma implanted mice on Day 11 when B16-F1 implanted mice became moribund. (K and L) Similar to the thymus, spleens of glioma-bearing mice (GL261-Luc implanted) are significantly reduced in size when compared to naïve unmanipulated controls (K, weight; L, cellularity). (M) Experimental design for implantation and analysis of RCAS-bearing spontaneous gliomas is shown. Briefly, DF1 chicken fibroblasts cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 39°C and 5% CO2 were transfected with RCAS vectors (PDGFb, H3.3K27M, and Cre recombinase). After 2–3 weeks of passaging, 105 DF1 cells with a 1:1:1 vector ratio or untransfected DF1controls were implanted into the brainstems of postnatal Day P3-P5 Nestin Tv-a, p53fl/fl pups. In this model, 3–5-day-old mice were intracranially injected with cells that can induce spontaneous glioma growth in the brainstem. After 28 days, all mice underwent T2-weighted MRI to assess tumour volumes. Mice with detectable tumours and non-tumour-bearing control mice were euthanized for assessment of the thymus. (N) Thymic weight and (O) cellularity in tumour-negative versus RCAS tumour-bearing is shown. n = 4–8 for RCAS experiments. n = 13–34 in GL261 experiment pooled from three to four independent experiments. n = 5 in B16-F1 experiment. All B16 implanted mice developed detectable tumours. Data are shown as individual mice with mean. Error bars represent standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess statistical significance. ns: P ≥ 0.05, *P = 0.01 to 0.05, **P = 0.001 to 0.01, ***P = 0.0001 to 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.",

  "figure_5": "Multifaceted systemic immunosuppression in glioma-bearing mice involves release of immunosuppressive soluble factors. (A) Schematic of parabiosis and verification of sharing of vasculature and GFP+ cells are shown. (B) Tumour burden is shown in the tumour-bearing parabiont compared to the tumour-free partner. (C) A representative flow plot of blood CD4 and CD8 frequencies is shown in both parabionts from three consecutive weeks post tumour implant. (D) MHCII expression on CD45+ cells in the blood is shown from three consecutive bleeds. (E) Thymi from naïve and glioma-bearing parabionts are compared to naïve-to-naïve parabionts. (E, left) Thymic weight and (E, right) cellularity is compared between naïve-to-naïve and naïve-to-tumour-bearing parabionts. (F) Parabiosis of a tumour-bearing to a non-tumour-bearing mouse revealed that T-cell sequestration in the bone marrow only occurs in the GL261+ parabiont and not in the attached tumour-free parabiont. (G) However, phenotype of bone marrow resident T cells changes in both tumour-bearing and tumour-free parabionts when compared to naïve-naïve counterparts. Exposure to the circulation of tumour-bearing mouse is sufficient to induce enrichment in naïve L selectin+ bone marrow resident T cells in the attached animal with no glioma in the brain. (H) Representative histograms depict CD4 (top) and CD8 (bottom) T-cell proliferation with and without anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads in the presence and absence of serum from naïve, tumour (−) and GL261 glioma-bearing mice. To do this assay, T cells from spleens and lymph nodes (inguinal, brachial, and axial lymph nodes) of naïve unmanipulated C57BL/6 mice were isolated and labelled with CFSE. Cells were plated either at 700 000 cells/well in a 96-well plate, or at 1.6 × 106 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Anti-CD3/CD28 beads were added at either 19 µl/well for 96-well plates or at 75 µl/well for 24-well plates. Total volume was 1 ml in 24-well plates and 250 µl in 96-well plates. To these cultures, we added 12.5µl of serum isolated from experimental mice to 96-well plates or 50 µl of serum in 24-well plates. CFSE dilution was assessed using flow cytometry 72 h later. CFSE dilution is shown. (I) Per cent cells with CFSE dilution is quantified as a measure of proliferation for each condition. (I, top) shows quantification for CD4 T-cells and (I, bottom) indicates CD8 quantification. (J) GL261 cell culture media is shown to not prevent T-cell proliferation. (K) Experimental design is shown for evaluation of memory responses generated against VSV-OVA during glioma progression. (L) Thymic and splenic (M) cellularity decreased in glioma-bearing mice previously infected with VSV-OVA compared to mice with no brain injury or tumour (−) controls. (N and O) Frequencies and numbers of Kb:OVA tetramer + CD8 T cells are quantified in spleens of glioma-bearing and control mice 4 days post VSV-OVA rechallenge. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to assess statistical significance for groups larger than two. For comparisons between two groups, Mann-Whitney U-test was used. For F and G, one-way ANOVA was performed and then an uncorrected Fisher’s LSD test was used to compare selected pairs. ns: P ≥ 0.05, *P = 0.01 to 0.05, **P = 0.001 to 0.01, ***P = 0.0001 to 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.

  "figure_6": "Acute neurological insults with various origins that are delivered to the CNS result in similar thymic involution. (A) Experimental design is shown. (B) Thymi were analysed on Day 7 post neurological insults. (B) Thymic cellularity is quantified in C57BL/6 (left) and in SJL mice (right) 7 days post TMEV (intracranial, i.c) infection. (C) Thymic cellularity is significantly decreased post LPS (i.c.) injection compared to naïve controls. (D) Gross comparison of thymi from sham control (PBS i.c) and naïve unmanipulated mice. (E, left, and F, left) Thymic weight and cellularity are both significantly reduced in mice injected with PBS (i.c) (E and F). The decrease in thymic cellularity post PBS injection is reproduced in both male (E) and female (F) mice. (G) Mice injected with KA that had an acute seizure activity measured by Racine’s modified scoring system, had a similar thymic involution. In male mice, seizure was induced by injecting 17.5 mg/kg of KA per mouse. In female mice, seizure was induced using 15.5 mg/kg of KA. All mice received valproic acid to stop seizure activity at 90 min post KA injection. Mice injected with KA were scored using a modified Racine score. Mice with scores of 0 were excluded from the study. Fifty per cent of males experienced a stage 4/5 seizure and died within the first hour post KA injection, thus only the remaining mice were used for analysis. Female mice that did not have any seizure activity by 50 min were injected with an extra 3 mg/kg of KA and their seizure activity was monitored. (H) TMEV infection or (I) PBS injection intraperitoneally (IP) do not induce thymic involution. (J) Thymic involution due to intracranial injection of PBS is reversible. (J) Thymi were harvested at time points post intracranial injection and cellularity was evaluated. (K) Thymic involution following the clearance of TMEV is also reversible. (K, left) Thymic involution as measured by a reduction in thymic cellularity and (K, right) thymic weight is observed on Day 7 post intracranial TMEV infection, but not on Day 30. (L) T-cell proliferation is shown in the presence of serum isolated from TMEV (i.c) infected mice on Days 7, 14 and 30 post infection. n = 5–23 based on the experiment. Graphs show pooled data from two to five independent experiments. Data are shown as individual mice with mean. Error bars represent standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U-test or a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to assess statistical significance. ns: P ≥ 0.05, *P = 0.01 to 0.05, **P = 0.001 to 0.01, ***P = 0.0001 to 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.",
  "figure_8": "Serum of glioma-bearing mice harbours a novel immunosuppressive factor with molecular weight >100 kD. (A) Sera obtained from naïve or glioma-bearing mice were isolated and passed through column-filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 3, 10, 30, or 100 kDa. Both top and bottom fractions were collected and their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation was tested. T cells obtained from naïve mice were labelled with CFSE and cultured with anti CD3/CD28 Dynabeads in the presence of individual fractions isolated from serum of naïve or glioma-bearing mice. Proliferation was measured 72 h later using flow cytometry. Serum fractions with high molecular weights (>3, >10, >30, >100 kDa) were deemed immunosuppressive as they potently inhibited T-cell proliferation in vitro. These data argue against cortisol or other small molecules related to stress hormone pathways playing a role as the immunosuppressive factor produced by the brain during neurological injuries. The molecular weight of the immunosuppressive factor released into serum during neurological injuries is >100 kDa. (B and C) Consistent with this, we tested the serum obtained from glioma-bearing wild-type (WT) or adrenalectomized mice. Serum isolated from glioma-bearing wild-type and adrenalectomized mice inhibited T-cell proliferation in vitro. (D) Glioma-bearing adrenalectomized mice did not have a survival benefit over wild-type mice despite lacking several facets of immunosuppression. For A, sera obtained from 10 GL261-bearing mice were pooled for analysis. For B and C, n = 3–10. Data are shown as individual mice with mean. Error bars represent standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess statistical significance. ns: P ≥ 0.05, *P = 0.01 to 0.05, **P = 0.001 to 0.01, ***P = 0.0001 to 0.001, **** P < 0.0001."
