  "figure_1": "Identification of 4 oncogenic NTRK point mutations in patient samples. (A) Among the 185 patient samples sequenced using a custom capture library consisting of 1862 kinase and kinase-associated genes, 10 patients harbored a mutation in 1 of the NTRK genes. The NTRK2R458G mutation was found in 2 patients. Mutations are organized by gene and diagnosis. Patient specimen identifier (ID) is also provided. (B) NTRK2A203T, NTRK2R458G, NTRK3E176D, and NTRK3L449F mutations transform the murine Ba/F3 pro-B cell line and enable interleukin 3 (IL-3)–independent growth. No growth was observed in Ba/F3 cells harboring an empty vector (pMX-puro) or wild-type (WT) NTRK2 or NTRK3. Total viable cells are plotted over time and cell growth was measured after the withdrawal of IL-3. This experiment was repeated at least twice with consistent results. Additional validation studies are found in supplemental Figure 2. (C-F) Electropherograms from Sanger sequencing of patient genomic DNA confirm the presence of NTRK2A203T, NTRK2R458G, NTRK3E176D, and NTRK3L449F mutations. Peaks correspond to the following nucleotides: A (green), T (red), C (blue), and G (black). Arrows indicate direction of sequencing. (G) Immunoblot analysis of total and phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB) and TrkC (p-TrkC) on patient samples with known NTRKA203T (12-00171), NTRKR458G (12-00337 and 13-00187), and NTRK3L449F (10-00828) mutations. (H) Gene schematics depict the location of prioritized NTRK2 and NTRK3 point mutations. The location of the following domains is included: leucine-rich repeat (LRR) N-terminal domain (LRRNT; NTRK2-specific), LRR 1, LRR 2, LRR C-terminal domain (LRRCT), immunoglobulin (Ig)-like C2-type 1, Ig-like C2-type 2, transmembrane (TM), juxtamembrane, and tyrosine kinase. aCML, atypical CML; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasm; NOS, not otherwise specified; VAF, variant allele frequency.",
  "figure_2": "NTRK2 and NTRK3 mutants are constitutively phosphorylated and sensitive to Trk inhibition. (A-B) Expression of total and phosphorylated TrkB and TrkC is increased in mutant-transformed Ba/F3 cells relative to WT cells. All mutants phosphorylate canonical downstream effectors, AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). STAT3 phosphorylation was not evident in NTRK2R458G. Both NTRK2 mutants result in increased SRC phosphorylation. GAPDH served as a loading control. Prior to lysis, WT cells were grown in IL-3–supplemented media and all lines were starved overnight in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) RPMI. (C-D) NTRK mutants are sensitive to entrectinib and larotrectinib. Six replicates of WT and mutant NTRK2 and NTRK3 Ba/F3 cells were plated with varying concentrations of entrectinib and larotrectinib for 72 hours. NTRK2WT and NTRK3WT cells were plated in media supplemented with IL-3. Cell viability was determined using a tetrazolamine-based viability assay. Viability is represented as a percentage of the untreated control. The average mean plus or minus SEM is shown. Additional validation studies are found in supplemental Figure 6B. (E) Mutant-transformed Ba/F3 cells were starved overnight in 0.1% BSA RPMI and then treated with increasing concentrations of entrectinib (ENT) for ∼16 hours and immunoblotted for Trk and downstream effectors. (F) ENT induces apoptosis in mutant-transformed Ba/F3 cells following 48 and 72 hours. Annexin V staining was performed in triplicate. The average mean plus or minus SEM is shown.

  "figure_3": "Mutants NTRK2A203T, NTRK3E176D, and NTRK3L449F increase Trk cell-surface localization but not retention. (A-B) To assess differences in mutant receptor localization, WT and mutant Ba/F3 cells were stained with APC-conjugated anti-TrkB or anti-TrkC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. A significantly higher localization of Trk receptors was observed with NTRK2A203T, NTRK3E176D, and NTRK3L449F mutants relative to their respective WT receptor. Validation of APC-conjugated Trk flow antibodies is shown in supplemental Figure 9C-D. (C-D) To assess receptor retention at the cell surface, WT and mutant NTRK2 and NTRK3 Ba/F3 cells were treated with 100 µg/mL cycloheximide for 12 or 24 hours, stained with APC-conjugated anti-TrkB or anti-TrkC antibodies, and analyzed via flow cytometry. Following 12 hours, NTRK2A203T was less stable than NTRK2WT. Both NTRK3 mutants were less stable than NTRK3WT after 12 and 24 hours of cycloheximide treatment. Normalized mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is shown over time. For all experiments, WT Ba/F3 cells were grown in IL-3–supplemented media and all lines were starved overnight in 0.1% BSA RPMI. Staining was performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was assessed by a 1-way or 2-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey multiple comparison test. All statistical comparisons shown are between WT and mutant receptors. The average mean plus or minus SEM is shown. *P < .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001; ****P < .0001.",
  "figure_4": "NTRK2A203T , NTRK3E176D , and NTRK3L449F exhibit increased receptor dimerization in comparison with their respective WT receptor. (A) Schematic of NTRK dimerization studies. A total of 0.5 µg of FLAG (F)- and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged NTRK WT or mutant constructs were cotransfected into HEK293T/17 cells and immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-FLAG beads. FLAG immunoprecipitates were then probed with an anti-HA antibody to detect the coimmunoprecipitating receptor, suggestive of receptor dimerization. The level of HA and FLAG coimmunoprecipitation was quantified using ImageJ and normalized to input. A higher ratio of HA to FLAG immunoprecipitation was indicative of increased receptor dimerization. (B-C) Immunoblot analysis and quantification of WT and mutant NTRK2 constructs suggest that the NTRK2A203T mutation caused increased receptor dimerization. (D-E) Increased receptor dimerization was seen with both NTRK3 mutants relative to WT as evident by immunoblot and quantification analysis. For all experiments, statistical significance was assessed by a 1-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey multiple comparison test. All statistical comparisons shown are between WT and mutant receptors. Three biological replicates were performed for each condition. Each experiment was performed at least twice with consistent results. The average mean plus or minus SEM is shown. *P < .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001."
