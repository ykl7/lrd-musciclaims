    - it verifies the claim: valid perturbation or not.

- 500 data points: contradictions.: by by qwen model
- 500: nuertral datapoints by swapping firgure names

- accuracy test is: small subset that doest go into training - run inference on that with trained model - see what performance.
- Get the total claims number and share it with yash.
